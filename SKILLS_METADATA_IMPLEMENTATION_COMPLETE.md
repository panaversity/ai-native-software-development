## How to Know If Skills Are "Right"

### The Five Validation Tests (From v2.0)

#### Test 1: Uniqueness
**Q**: Is this skill unique or a duplicate with a different name?
- ✓ Check Master Skill Registry before creating new skill
- ❌ "Evaluating Career Relevance" vs "Assessing Personal Role Transition" = same skill, different names

#### Test 2: Naming Convention
**Q**: Is the skill name clear and distinct?
- ✓ Use specific verbs: Recognizing, Understanding, Assessing, Evaluating, Personalizing
- ✓ Be specific: "Understanding AI Stack Architecture" not just "Understanding X"
- ❌ Same verb used 20+ times = loss of semantic clarity

#### Test 3: Proficiency Progression
**Q**: Does skill show A1→A2→B1 advancement, never regressing?
- ✓ Ch1, L1 (A1) → Ch3, L2 (A2) = progression ✓
- ❌ Ch2, L2 (A2) → Ch2, L3 (A1) = regression ✗

#### Test 4: Prerequisites
**Q**: Are all A2/B1 prerequisites taught before the skill?
- ✓ A2 skill should have A1 prerequisite taught earlier
- ❌ A2 skill with no A1 prerequisite = broken chain

#### Test 5: Connectivity
**Q**: Does skill connect to other skills or is it isolated?
- ✓ Skill appears in multiple chapters, building progressively
- ⚠️ Isolated OK if context-setting, but core skills should progress

## What We Learned From Part 1 Analysis

### Critical Issues Found

1. **Skill Fragmentation**: Same concept named differently
   - Fix: Use Master Skill Registry as canonical reference

2. **Missing Proficiency Prerequisites**: A2 skills without A1 foundation
   - Fix: Add missing A1 skills or document prerequisites

3. **Proficiency Regression**: Skills backtracking in proficiency level
   - Fix: Reorder lessons or correct proficiency assignment

4. **Isolated Skills**: Skills appearing once, never building
   - Fix: Integrate into progression track or acknowledge as context-setting

5. **Overused Verbs**: 20+ "Evaluating" skills without distinction
   - Fix: Use distinct verbs (Assess vs. Evaluate vs. Prioritize vs. Personalize)

### Solutions Implemented

✓ Created Master Skill Registry consolidating all part 1 skills
✓ Mapped 4 progression tracks showing skill building across chapters
✓ Identified 5 coherence tests to prevent future issues
✓ Enhanced skills-proficiency-mapper with validation framework
✓ Updated chapter-planner to enforce coherence checks
✓ Created practical validation guide for users

## Validation Framework Summary

### For Users

**Ask yourself**:
1. Is this skill unique, or does a similar skill already exist?
2. Is the skill name clear and would different people understand it the same way?
3. If skill appears multiple times, does proficiency increase (A1→A2→B1)?
4. Are all prerequisites taught before this skill?
5. Does skill build on previous knowledge and support future skills?

**Use these tools**:
- Master Skill Registry: Check for uniqueness and definitions
- Progression Map: Check for connectivity and progression
- Validation Checklist: Run 5 tests before finalizing

### For Agents

**chapter-planner should**:
- Use Phase 1.5 to map skills with v2.0 coherence checks
- Reference Master Skill Registry for dependencies
- Verify distinct verb usage in skill names
- Ensure skills connect to prior/future chapters

**lesson-writer should**:
- Validate content matches stated proficiency level (A1/A2/B1)
- Count new concepts against CEFR limits
- Align Bloom's cognitive level to proficiency
- Check prerequisites are actually taught

## Key Insight: The Coherence Principle

**Without Validation Framework**:
```
Ch1, L1: "Understanding AI Impact" (A1)
Ch2, L3: "Understanding AI as Amplifier" (A1) — Same skill? Different? Who knows?
Ch4, L1: "Recognizing Paradigm Shifts" (A1) — Related? Isolated? Unclear
Ch3, L5: "Evaluating Market Risk & Timing" (A2) — Has prerequisite? Where's A1?
```
→ Skills become fragmented, isolated, with unclear connections and broken prerequisites

**With Validation Framework**:
```
Ch1, L1: "Recognizing AI Impact on Development" (A1) — Foundation
        ↓ builds on
Ch2, L1: "Understanding Capability Breakthroughs" (A1) — Evidence
        ↓ deepens understanding
Ch2, L3: "Understanding AI as Amplifier" (A1) — Framework
        ↓ applies to
Ch4, L2: "Understanding AIDD Definition" (A1) → Ch4, L5: "Understanding M-Shaped Developer" (A2)
```
→ Clear progression, documented dependencies, intentional connections
