# Part 6: Agentic AI Fundamentals

**Chapters**: 3 | **Cognitive Load**: Moderate-High | **Scaffolding**: Light (1 review cycle expected)

## Purpose

Design and build autonomous AI agents that accomplish goals independently. Apply everything you've learned to create systems that can think and act.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Part 6, you will:
- Understand agentic AI concepts and patterns
- Design agent workflows and decision trees
- Build agents with tool integration
- Orchestrate multi-agent systems
- Debug and improve agent behavior

## Chapters in This Part

27. **Introduction to Agentic AI** — What are agents, agent vs chatbot, patterns, architecture, examples
28. **Building Your First Agent** — Simple agents, tool integration, execution loops, function calling
29. **Agent Orchestration and Real-World Applications** — Multi-agent coordination, error recovery, production patterns

## How This Part Works

- **Light scaffolding**: You're an experienced developer now; mostly working independently
- **Moderate-high concept density**: 5-6 key concepts per chapter
- **Advanced focus**: Cutting-edge patterns and production considerations
- **Practical building**: Create working agents with real capabilities

## Prerequisites

- Complete **Part 4: Modern Python with Type Hints** (production Python skills)
- Complete **Part 5: Spec-Kit Methodology** (project structure understanding)
- Comfortable with Parts 1-3 (AI collaboration and communication)

## What Comes Next

After completing Part 6, you'll be ready for **Part 7: MCP Fundamentals**, the final part where we learn to extend AI capabilities through standardized protocols.
