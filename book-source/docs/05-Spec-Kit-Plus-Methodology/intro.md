# Part 5: Spec-Kit Methodology

**Chapters**: 5 | **Cognitive Load**: Moderate | **Scaffolding**: Moderate (1-2 review cycles expected)

## Purpose

Learn Specification-Driven Development (SDD), a professional workflow for planning, structuring, and executing projects at scale.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Part 5, you will:
- Understand Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology
- Write effective specifications (requirements, scope, success criteria)
- Create comprehensive plans (architecture, phases, milestones)
- Decompose projects into tasks
- Coordinate teams using shared specifications

## Chapters in This Part

22. **Specification-Driven Development Fundamentals** — Why SDD matters, spec vs plan vs tasks, iterative workflow
23. **Writing Effective Specifications** — User scenarios, functional requirements, success criteria
24. **Planning and Tasking** — Architecture decisions, phases, task breakdown, dependencies
25. **Real-World Spec-Kit Workflows** — Case studies, practical patterns, common mistakes
26. **Scaling Spec-Kit for Teams** — Communication patterns, code review, version control

## Grounding Framework

This part teaches the SDD methodology that is core to Panaversity's philosophy. This book itself was written using Spec-Kit!

## How This Part Works

- **Meta-reference**: The chapters use this book's creation as a worked example
- **Moderate scaffolding**: You're experienced now; guided through advanced concepts
- **Moderate concept density**: 4-6 key concepts per chapter
- **Collaborative focus**: How teams communicate through specs and plans

## Prerequisites

- Complete **Part 4: Modern Python with Type Hints** (professional-level thinking)
- Comfortable with Parts 1-3 (AI collaboration and communication)

## What Comes Next

After completing Part 5, you'll be ready for **Part 6: Agentic AI Fundamentals**, where we build autonomous systems using everything we've learned.
