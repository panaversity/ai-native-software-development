# Part 5: Spec-Kit Plus Methodology

## Welcome to Professional Software Development Workflow

After mastering AI tools, prompting techniques, and Python fundamentals in Parts 1-4, you're ready for the shift that separates tactical developers from strategic architects: **Specification-Driven Development (SDD)**.

Part 5 teaches you how to think and work like a AI Native & specification-first professional. Instead of jumping into code, you'll learn to write clear specifications that enable:
- **Fast implementation** through AI agents that understand exactly what to build
- **Confident teams** coordinating work through shared specifications
- **Scalable systems** that grow from solo projects to 100+ person organizations without chaos

This is the methodology that powers organizations like Amazon, Stripe, and every successful company building with AI agents.

## What You'll Learn

### Chapter 30: Understanding Specification-Driven Development Fundamentals (PHILOSOPHY)
**Duration**: 14-18 hours | **8 Lessons**

Understand *why* specifications matter and *where* SDD is heading. Through discovery-based learning with AI companions, you'll experience how vague specs fail, understand SDD philosophy and tools, explore the history of why SDD emerged NOW (2024), and commit personally to specification-first practice.

**Topics**:
- Vague Code and the AI Partner Problem (Experience the cost)
- What Is Specification-Driven Development? (Discover through dialogue)
- Build Your First Spec Together (Hands-on password reset system)

- Explore the Tools (Kiro, Spec-Kit, Tessel—choose your fit)
- Where Is SDD Heading? (Spec-as-source promise and challenges)
- Your Specification-Driven Development Commitment (Personal commitment and 3-month review)

**You'll be able to**:
- Diagnose when vague specs are causing problems
- Write clear specifications that prevent miscommunication
- Design a Constitution for your team
- Choose the right SDD tool for your context
- Commit to specification-driven practice

### Chapter 31: Spec-Kit Plus Hands-On (PRACTICE)
**Duration**: 19-26 hours | **7 Lessons + 2 Mini-Projects**

Learn *how* to write specifications and use Spec-Kit Plus tools. You'll practice spec building with a Python calculator project, then write a real-world grading system specification that becomes your capstone project in Chapter 32.

**Topics**:
- Help Your Companion Write a Better Spec (Discover 6 components through coaching)
- Set Up Your Project With Spec-Kit Plus (Explore structure and workflow)
- Make Your Acceptance Criteria Clear (Vague → SMART → proven quality)
- Run /sp.specify with Your Companion (Iterative spec refinement)
- Run /sp.plan and See the Implementation Plan (Spec quality cascades)
- Decompose Your Spec Into Atomic Tasks (Small, buildable units)
- Build Your Grading System Spec End-to-End (Full workflow integration)

**Mini-Projects**:
1. **Python Calculator Spec-First** (Safe, bounded scope) — Complete the full SDD cycle: spec → plan → tasks → implement → validate
2. **Grading System Specification** (Real-world scope, YC-validated) — Write a production-ready specification for an assignment grading system

**You'll be able to**:
- Write complete specifications with proper acceptance criteria
- Use Spec-Kit Plus commands (/sp.specify, /sp.plan, /sp.tasks)
- Recognize spec quality through cascade effects
- Validate code against specifications

### Chapter 32: Real-World Spec-Kit Workflows & Capstone (SCALE)
**Duration**: 18-20 hours | **7 Lessons + 1 Capstone Project**

Master *how to scale* SDD from solo work to team coordination. Learn team workflows, feature decomposition, understand how agents stay current with evolving APIs, and implement a capstone project that simulates team parallelization through multi-agent specification coordination.

**Topics**:
- SDD at Scale — From Solo to Teams (1-person to 100-person scaling)
- Feature Decomposition for Parallel Work (Independence and interfaces)
- Team Workflows & Spec-Driven Practices (Code review gates, templates)
- Scaling to 10+ Person Teams (Governance and service contracts)
- Real-World Integration — SDD in Production (APIs, databases, agents, deployment)
- **How Agents Stay Current — Context Architecture** (NEW: Keeping specs and agents in sync)
- SDD Philosophy & Professional Practice (Career implications and synthesis)

**Capstone Project**:
**Assignments Grading & Feedback Agentic System** — Build the grading system specification you wrote in Chapter 31 using parallel AI agents:
- Part 1: Decompose the grading spec into 2 independent features (Grading Engine + Feedback Generation)
- Part 2: Run two AI agents in parallel (Claude Code + Gemini CLI) on different features
- Part 3: Reflect on how clear specifications enabled parallelization without direct team communication

**You'll be able to**:
- Design systems for parallel development
- Manage specification-driven teams
- Understand how SDD scales from startup to enterprise
- Lead teams using specification-first methodology

## Learning Path & Time Commitment

| Chapter | Focus | Hours | Weeks | Difficulty |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|-----------|
| 30 | Philosophy & Discovery | 14-18h | 2-2.5w | Intermediate |
| 31 | Hands-On Practice | 19-26h | 3-4w | Intermediate-Advanced |
| 32 | Scaling, Architecture & Capstone | 18-20h | 2.5-3w | Advanced |
| **TOTAL** | **Professional Workflow** | **51-64h** | **8-9.5w** | **Advanced** |

**Recommended pace**: 6-8 hours per week, allowing time for mini-projects, reflection, and capstone implementation.

## Prerequisites

You must have completed:
- ✅ **Part 1**: AI-native mindset and fundamentals
- ✅ **Part 2**: AI tools (Claude Code, Gemini CLI)
- ✅ **Part 3**: Prompt engineering and context
- ✅ **Part 4**: Python 3.13+ with type hints

If you haven't completed Parts 1-4, go back and finish them first. They build the foundation that makes Part 5 meaningful.

## After Part 5: Your Next Steps

Part 5 enables everything that follows. Once you complete this part, you're ready for:

- **Part 6: Agentic AI Fundamentals** — Agents need clear behavior specifications to work effectively
- **Part 10: Docker & Kubernetes** — Deployment configurations are specifications
- **Part 11: Data, State & Memory** — Database schemas are specifications
- **Part 13: Stateful Agents** — Workflow orchestration requires specification-first thinking

Every part from 6+ assumes you think in specifications first, code second. This is the mindset shift that makes you a professional software architect.

## Special Note: AI & Specifications

Throughout Part 5, you'll use AI agents (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, ChatGPT) as your collaboration partners. This isn't about AI replacing you—it's about AI working *better* when you're explicit about what you want.

A vague prompt to an AI produces vague results. A clear specification enables that AI to generate professional-quality work. This is the core insight of Part 5: **specifications are instructions to AI**. Master this, and you master modern software development.

---

## Getting Help

- **Stuck on a lesson?** Re-read the specification for that lesson. The answer is usually there.
- **Don't understand a concept?** Try the "Try With AI" exercise. Hands-on discovery beats explanation.
- **Want to see real examples?** Chapter 27 capstone walks through a real project end-to-end.
- **Ready to teach others?** The pedagogical patterns in this part are designed to be repurposable. Adapt them for your context.
