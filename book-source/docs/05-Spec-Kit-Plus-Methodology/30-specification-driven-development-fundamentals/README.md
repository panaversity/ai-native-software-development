# Chapter 30: Understanding Specification-Driven Development Fundamentals

## Overview

Chapter 30 teaches specification-driven development through **discovery and dialogue**, not lectures. Students don't learn about SDD in isolation—they **discover specifications through problems and ask their companion questions**, learning by thinking together.

This chapter implements **AI-native pedagogy**: Student + Companion DISCOVER SDD together, learning by experiencing the problem, asking questions, and understanding through dialogue.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing Chapter 30, students will be able to:

1. **Diagnose** when vague specifications are causing problems and cost
2. **Explain** specification-driven development philosophy in their own words
3. **Write** a specification with clear intent, requirements, and test scenarios
4. **Design** a Constitution for their team or domain
5. **Connect** SDD to its historical context and understand why it emerged NOW
6. **Evaluate** SDD tools (Kiro, Spec-Kit Plus, Tessel) and choose appropriately for their context
7. **Assess** spec-as-source realistically—its promise, challenges, and appropriate domains
8. **Commit** specifically and measurably to specification-driven practice

These are not theoretical. You will apply and demonstrate concepts through reflection exercises and the final commitment.
