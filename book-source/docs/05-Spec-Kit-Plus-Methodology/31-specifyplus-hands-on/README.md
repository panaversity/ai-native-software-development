# Chapter 31: Spec-Kit Plus Hands-On

Welcome to hands-on specification-driven development. This chapter transforms understanding (from Chapter 30) into practice. You won't read about specifications—you'll write them. You won't learn about AI collaboration—you'll build projects with your AI companion from specifications to implementation.

Through eight interconnected lessons, you'll master the Spec-Kit Plus workflow: /sp.specify → /sp.plan → /sp.tasks → implementation. You'll experience the cascade effect where specification quality determines everything downstream. Most importantly, you'll build the muscle memory for specification-first thinking that makes you dramatically faster in Chapters 32 and beyond.

Whether you're eager to start coding or skeptical that specs are worth the time, this chapter proves the value through direct experience: building projects specification-first is faster, more reliable, and more scalable than code-first development.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

- **Coach clarity from vague ideas**: Transform "build a calculator" into explicit requirements with acceptance criteria through dialogue with your AI companion—discovering the questions that reveal hidden requirements
- **Master the Spec-Kit Plus workflow**: Use /sp.specify to generate structured specifications, /sp.plan to create implementation plans, and /sp.tasks to decompose work—understanding how each tool amplifies your clarity
- **Write SMART acceptance criteria**: Create testable, unambiguous success criteria that prevent misinterpretation—learning the difference between "works correctly" (vague) and "returns 12 when given 3 \* 4" (SMART)
- **Recognize quality through cascade effects**: Understand how specification quality determines plan quality, which determines task quality, which determines code quality—and how to diagnose problems at the right level
- **Build from specifications, not code**: Implement a Python calculator by starting with specifications and letting AI agents handle implementation—experiencing the paradigm shift from code-first to spec-first
- **Validate implementations against specs**: Use specifications as the source of truth for testing—writing test scenarios that verify code matches intent, not just "runs without errors"
- **Write production-grade specifications**: Create a real-world grading system specification with edge cases, error handling, and extensibility considerations—building the foundation for Chapter 32's capstone
- **Collaborate specification-first with AI**: Develop fluency in the back-and-forth dialogue with AI companions where you provide intent and critique output while AI handles structure and completeness

## What Makes This Chapter Different

**You'll practice every concept immediately.** Unlike Chapter 30's philosophical exploration, Chapter 31 is hands-on from the first lesson. You'll write specifications, generate plans, decompose tasks, and implement code—learning by doing, with your AI companion as partner.

**You'll experience the cascade effect directly.** When a vague specification produces a weak plan, you won't be told "specifications matter"—you'll diagnose the problem yourself, improve the specification, and watch the plan quality improve. This experiential learning builds intuition that lectures can't provide.

**You'll build two complete projects.** First, a Python calculator (simple domain, focus on workflow). Second, a grading system specification (complex domain, focus on production quality). By the end, you'll have practical artifacts and lived experience with specification-driven development.

## Ready?

The next eight lessons will transform you from code-first to specification-first developer. You'll stop opening VS Code as the first step and start writing specifications. You'll stop debugging mysterious behaviors and start validating against explicit acceptance criteria. You'll stop explaining projects verbally and start pointing to specifications that capture exact intent.

Let's build this together.
