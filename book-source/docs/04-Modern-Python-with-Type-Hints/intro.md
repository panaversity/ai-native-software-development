# Part 4: Modern Python with Type Hints

**Chapters**: 8 | **Cognitive Load**: High | **Scaffolding**: Moderate (1-2 review cycles expected)

## Purpose

Learn production-quality Python programming with Python 3.13+ features, type hints, and comprehensive testing practices.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Part 4, you will:
- Write Python with complete type annotations (Python 3.13+ features)
- Use modern syntax (match/case, structural patterns, etc.)
- Implement comprehensive testing (unit, integration)
- Handle errors professionally
- Work with APIs and external data
- Design clean, maintainable code (patterns, best practices)
- Build realistic, complete projects

## Chapters in This Part

14. **Functions, Types, and Type Hints** — Function definitions, type annotations, protocols, generics
15. **Data Structures with Type Safety** — Lists, dicts, sets, typing module, custom collections
16. **Object-Oriented Programming (Modern)** — Classes, inheritance, protocols, dataclasses, patterns
17. **Testing and Quality Assurance** — pytest, unit tests, fixtures, mocking, coverage
18. **Error Handling and Debugging** — Exception hierarchy, custom exceptions, debugging strategies
19. **Working with APIs and Data** — HTTP requests, JSON, data validation, API patterns
20. **Clean Code and Design Patterns** — SOLID principles, design patterns, refactoring
21. **Building Your First Real Project** — Project structure, integration, deployment, portfolio

## Grounding Source

This part is grounded in the [Learn Modern AI Python](https://github.com/panaversity/learn-modern-ai-python/tree/main/00_python_colab) colabs from Panaversity.

## How This Part Works

- **Moderate scaffolding**: More independence expected; guided where needed
- **High concept density**: 5-7 key concepts per chapter (highest in the book)
- **Building complexity**: Each chapter builds on previous ones
- **Hands-on focus**: Write actual code with AI assistance

## Prerequisites

- Complete **Part 1: Introducing AI-Driven Development** (AI fundamentals)
- Complete **Part 3: Prompt & Context Engineering** (AI communication)
- Comfortable with Part 2 (understand your AI tool choice)

## What Comes Next

After completing Part 4, you'll be ready for **Part 5: Spec-Kit Methodology**, where we learn to structure larger projects professionally.
