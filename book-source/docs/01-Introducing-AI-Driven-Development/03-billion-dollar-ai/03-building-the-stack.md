# Building the Stack

## Connecting the Dots

In Lesson 2, you designed an orchestrator. You picked a domain. You defined what it would coordinate. You listed the specialists it would need.

Now comes the practical question: **How does the orchestrator actually *talk* to those specialists?**

This is where **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** comes in. It's the language that lets them work together at scale.

---

## What is MCP?

MCP is a **protocol**—a standardized way for AI systems to coordinate work.

Think of it like **HTTP for the web** or **Standard Car Shape by all manufactur  in Auto Industry**. HTTP is the agreement between browsers and servers:
- "Here's what a request looks like"
- "Here's what a response looks like"
- "Here's how we handle errors"

MCP does the same thing for AI orchestration:
- **Request shape**: "Specialist, analyze this dataset for me"
- **Response shape**: "Here's the analysis with these fields: risk_level, recommendation, confidence"
- **Error handling**: "If you can't complete this, return an error with this structure"

Every specialist that speaks MCP is **interchangeable**. You can swap in a different analyzer, and the orchestrator doesn't need to change. **The contract stays the same.**

## Why MCP Matters

MCP solves three critical problems:

### 1. Scalability

One orchestrator can coordinate **dozens of specialists**, even if they're built by different teams, in different languages, using different models. MCP is the translator.

### 2. Reliability

When a specialist fails, the orchestrator **knows exactly what went wrong** (MCP has error codes). It can retry, escalate, or use a backup. No ambiguity.

### 3. Modularity

You can build specialists **independently**. Test them independently. Deploy them independently. As long as they speak MCP, they plug into your orchestrator.

## The Architecture in Practice

Here's what a real system looks like:

```
User Request
     ↓
ORCHESTRATOR (Your Business Logic)
  - Parse: What are you asking?
  - Plan: What work needs to happen?
  - Route: Which specialists needed?
  - Validate: Is this correct?
     ↓
[Specialist 1] [Specialist 2] [Specialist 3] [Specialist 4]
(All speak MCP)
```

Each specialist is focused. The orchestrator coordinates. MCP is the communication layer.

---

## Key Takeaway

MCP isn't something you build from scratch. **It's already here.**

Anthropic created it. OpenAI adopted it. Google is building support for it. Microsoft is integrating it. By the time you read this, there are probably **200+ pre-built specialists** available that speak MCP.

This means: **You don't spend 6 months building integrations. You spend 2 weeks composing existing ones.**

## Pause and Reflect

For your vertical from Lesson 2:

1. **What would an MCP "request" look like?** (What shape of data would the orchestrator send to specialists?)
2. **What would an MCP "response" look like?** (What fields would the specialist return?)

These questions will anchor Lesson 4's strategy discussion.
