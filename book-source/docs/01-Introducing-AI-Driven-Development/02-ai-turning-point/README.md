# Chapter 2: AI Turning Point

## The New Wave of AI Coding Agents Has Changed Everything for Developers

---

## Welcome

In Chapter 1, you discovered a fundamental shift: you're no longer just a "coder." You're becoming an **orchestrator**â€”directing AI partners to do work alongside you.

Chapter 2 answers the critical questions that follow:

- **Is 2025 really different from 2024?** Or is this just hype?
- **How should I approach AI-assisted development?** Should I just vibe code and ship fast?
- **Why do some teams succeed with AI while others fail?** What's the difference?
- **Which AI tool should I use?** Are they all the same? Will I be locked in?
- **What's my role now?** How does discipline apply to AI-assisted work?

This chapter provides evidence-based answers, concrete frameworks, and practical tool guidance.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. **Recognize concrete evidence** that 2025 represents a genuine inflection point for AI-assisted development
2. **Distinguish between vibe coding and Spec-Driven Development**, and understand when each approach is appropriate
3. **Explain why organizational discipline matters MORE with AI**, not less (DORA research findings)
4. **Identify and select among four major AI coding agents** based on your specific needs, constraints, and goals
5. **Understand the Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and why standardization prevents vendor lock-in
6. **Apply an orchestrator's mindset** to AI-assisted coding: asking good questions, reviewing work, and thinking strategically

You've shifted your mindset (Chapter 1). Now you understand the context, evidence, and tools (Chapter 2).

*This is not a skim chapter. It's foundational context for everything that follows.*
