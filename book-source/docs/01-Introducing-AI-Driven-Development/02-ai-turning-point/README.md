# Chapter 2: AI Turning Point

## Overview

In Chapter 1, you discovered a fundamental shift: you're no longer just a "coder." You're becoming an *orchestrator*—directing AI partners to do work alongside you.

Chapter 2 answers the critical questions that follow: Is 2025 really different from 2024? How should you approach AI-assisted development? Why do some teams succeed with AI while others fail? What tools should you use, and what risks should you navigate?

This chapter provides evidence-based answers, concrete frameworks, and practical guidance. You'll see why 2025 represents a genuine inflection point, understand the difference between vibe coding and Spec-Driven Development, learn what organizational capabilities predict AI success, explore the modern three-layer AI development stack, and chart your path forward through the challenges.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have the context, frameworks, and confidence to adopt AI-driven development thoughtfully—with discipline, not just speed.

## Main Learning Outcomes

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

1. *Recognize concrete evidence*: Identify the three convergent trends (capability breakthroughs, mainstream adoption, enterprise productization) that make 2025 different from previous AI waves
2. *Distinguish development patterns*: Explain when vibe coding is appropriate vs. when Spec-Driven Development (SDD) is necessary, and understand the 7-step SDD workflow
3. *Apply DORA capabilities*: Explain the "AI as amplifier" thesis and assess your team's readiness across the seven DORA organizational capabilities
4. *Understand the modern stack*: Describe the three-layer AI development architecture (Frontier Models, AI-First IDEs, Development Agents) and explain how MCP prevents vendor lock-in
5. *Navigate challenges strategically*: Identify the three core challenges of AI-driven development (over-reliance, quality drift, cost management) and apply mitigation strategies
6. *Articulate your path forward*: Evaluate your position in the AI transformation and make informed decisions about adoption with appropriate guardrails
