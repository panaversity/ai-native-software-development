  questions={[
    {
      question: "A developer claims that 70% adoption represents a minor trend, not a paradigm shift. What evidence contradicts this claim?",
      options: [
        "ICPC achievements prove AI capability but don't measure paradigm shifts directly",
        "Mainstream adoption above 80% historically signals technologies becoming professional infrastructure",
        "Stack Overflow surveys are too limited to show industry-wide trends accurately",
        "Claude Code's $500M ARR is too recent to confirm adoption is long-term"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The chapter establishes that 84% developer adoption represents a paradigm shift by comparing it to smartphones crossing 50% in 2012, which reshaped business entirely. At 80%+ adoption, using AI becomes the default assumption—not using AI becomes the exception. This threshold is how we identify when a technology moves from experimental to mainstream infrastructure. The other options either misinterpret the evidence or dismiss it without valid reasoning."
    },
    {
      question: "Why does the ICPC World Finals perfect score represent a significant milestone beyond simple performance metrics?",
      options: [
        "It shows AI can memorize programming algorithms faster than human developers",
        "It demonstrates AI can solve difficult problems requiring reasoning and debugging judgment",
        "It proves AI will eventually replace all human programmers in the future",
        "It indicates AI excels at standardized tests but not real-world problems"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The ICPC perfect score demonstrates that AI can tackle novel, creative problems requiring reasoning under pressure and debugging judgment—not just pattern matching. The chapter emphasizes that ICPC problems require 'creative problem-solving under pressure, the ability to debug when your intuition was wrong,' showing a qualitative leap in AI capability. This moves beyond what seemed possible just one year earlier, indicating genuine progress in problem-solving ability rather than incremental performance gains."
    },
    {
      question: "A team uses vibe coding to build a personal learning project in their spare time. Is this appropriate according to the chapter?",
      options: [
        "No, Spec-Driven Development should always be used regardless of any context",
        "Yes, vibe coding is excellent for learning with affordable rework costs throughout",
        "Yes, but only if the developer has more than 5 years of experience",
        "No, personal projects require the same formality as production code always"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The chapter explicitly lists 'Learning' and 'Low Stakes Solo Work' as contexts where vibe coding excels, stating it 'gives you immediate feedback' and 'Rework costs are low.' This is appropriate because the consequences of architecture drift are minimal. The core lesson is context-dependent appropriateness: vibe coding for exploration, SDD for production. Personal learning projects fall squarely in the vibe coding category because mistakes are affordable learning opportunities."
    },
    {
      question: "In the Team A vs. Team B comparison, Team A ships a feature in 10 hours using vibe coding without tests. In week two, they discover the code doesn't support extensions. Why does this happen?",
      options: [
        "The developer lacked sufficient skill to design extensible code initially",
        "Vibe coding skips specification and testing so code evolves without architectural planning",
        "The feature is inherently difficult to extend regardless of development method",
        "Spec-Driven Development would have taken too long to meet any deadline"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The comparison demonstrates that vibe coding's predictable failure mode is architecture drift. Without specification and testing, code 'evolves organically,' and designers make no upfront decisions about extensibility. Team B succeeded by writing a 'document parser abstraction that allows multiple format handlers,' a design decision that requires upfront thinking. The chapter shows both teams took similar time—the difference was Team B spent time planning, Team A paid that time in rework."
    },
    {
      question: "The chapter states: 'AI is an amplifier of whatever practice you bring to it.' What does this mean for organizations with weak testing practices?",
      options: [
        "AI will automatically improve testing practices without additional effort required",
        "Weak testing practices amplify too because AI helps ship untested code faster",
        "Organizations should abandon testing entirely and rely on AI quality instead",
        "Testing becomes irrelevant when using AI tools in development workflows"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "This is the core DORA insight from Lesson 3. Weak testing practices don't improve through AI use—they amplify. The chapter illustrates this with struggling organizations that see deployment frequency increase but failure rates climb because their weak practices scale with AI assistance. Conversely, strong practices also amplify: high-performing teams capture disproportionate value from AI because their testing and review processes multiply the leverage."
    },
    {
      question: "According to DORA research, which statement accurately describes high-performing organizations that adopt AI?",
      options: [
        "They abandon code review to ship faster with AI assistance overall",
        "They combine AI with pre-existing strong practices for sustainable velocity gains",
        "They focus exclusively on velocity metrics ignoring all stability metrics entirely",
        "They use AI to replace human developers and reduce team size significantly"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The DORA section explicitly states high-performing organizations have 'test-driven development, code review discipline, incremental deployment, incident response processes' BEFORE adopting AI. When they add AI tools, 'Velocity increases by 10-20% without sacrificing quality.' The discipline enables the leverage. High-performing teams don't abandon practices; they use AI to scale them. This is the difference between real ROI (velocity + stability) and unsustainable velocity (speed without safety)."
    },
    {
      question: "A struggling organization has minimal testing and ad-hoc code reviews. They adopt an AI assistant and see deployments increase from 2/week to 10/week, but change failure rate jumps from 5% to 18%. What is actually happening?",
      options: [
        "This is positive progress so faster deployment is always good regardless",
        "The organization amplifies its lack of discipline creating negative ROI and debt",
        "The AI tool is defective and should be replaced with another tool",
        "The team needs to ship even faster to catch up on missed deliverables"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "This is the struggling organization scenario from DORA. The chapter explains: 'Velocity increases sharply, but stability deteriorates faster... Faster shipping without stability is expensive... The organization is building technical debt faster than repaying it.' From 8 additional deployments per week at 18% failure rate means more bugs in production, requiring recovery time and creating customer trust costs that offset velocity gains. This demonstrates why discipline is MORE critical, not less, when AI amplifies your practices."
    },
    {
      question: "According to the chapter's context table, which development context is Spec-Driven Development LEAST suitable for?",
      options: [
        "Shipping code to production that will be maintained for years",
        "Adding language features to an existing compiler used widely",
        "Exploring a brand-new technology you are learning for the first time",
        "Building features in a large team where multiple people collaborate"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The context table explicitly places 'Learning a new technology' in the 'Vibe Coding Excellent / SDD Unnecessary friction' row. The chapter states: 'When you're new to a language or framework, vibe coding gives you immediate feedback.' Exploration and learning benefit from tight feedback loops, not upfront planning. All other options (production code, team collaboration, existing systems) are contexts where SDD provides essential clarity and coordination."
    },
    {
      question: "A developer using Claude Code in a team with comprehensive testing and code review produces AI-generated code. Why is this likely to result in good outcomes?",
      options: [
        "Claude Code never makes mistakes in any situation whatsoever",
        "The team's testing and code review practices catch broken code immediately",
        "Good outcomes are guaranteed by any development method or tool available",
        "The developer's individual skill is the only factor that matters most"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The chapter explains: 'A developer using Claude Code in a strong test-driven environment is generating code that runs against a comprehensive test suite immediately. Broken code is caught in seconds.' The team's practices (testing, review) are the foundation that enables AI to succeed. This illustrates how discipline multiplies leverage: bad practices amplify bad outcomes, good practices amplify good outcomes. AI is a tool; the team's practices determine results."
    },
    {
      question: "What key differentiator distinguishes Qwen Code from Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and OpenAI Codex?",
      options: [
        "Qwen Code has the fastest context window for processing large codebases",
        "Qwen Code is the only option with native Slack integration available",
        "Qwen Code is open-source under Apache 2.0 license and can be self-hosted",
        "Qwen Code has the largest free tier with unlimited daily requests allowed"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The Qwen Code section explicitly states: 'Unlike the others, you're not renting access—you own the model... Released under the Apache 2.0 license... You can run it locally, customize it, fine-tune it, or deploy it on your own servers.' This open-source nature and self-hosting capability distinguish it from proprietary tools. Option A is false: Claude Code has 200K+ tokens, larger than Qwen's 128K. Options B and D refer to other tools' features."
    },
    {
      question: "A solo developer wants to minimize costs while building a personal project with maximum context visibility into their entire codebase. Which tool should they try first?",
      options: [
        "Claude Code (Pro) for superior reasoning capabilities overall",
        "Gemini CLI with its free tier and 1M token context window",
        "OpenAI Codex for team collaboration features and capabilities",
        "Qwen Code because it is always the most cost-effective option"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "Gemini's free tier provides '1,000 requests/day' with a '1M token context window—the largest of any AI agent.' For solo development with maximum codebase visibility at minimum cost, this is optimal. The chapter recommends Gemini for 'Budget-conscious learners.' Option A costs $20/month unnecessarily. Option C adds unnecessary team features. Option D requires infrastructure setup for self-hosting."
    },
    {
      question: "What problem does Model Context Protocol (MCP) solve in the AI tool ecosystem?",
      options: [
        "It prevents all AI tools from being used simultaneously in the same project",
        "It standardizes how AI agents communicate with tools preventing vendor lock-in",
        "It guarantees that all AI agents produce equally good code always",
        "It eliminates the need for developers to understand any tool differences"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The chapter states: 'MCP is an open standard... that lets any AI agent talk to any tool... It prevents vendor lock-in because you can swap agents later without rewriting workflows. It's like USB for AI.' Instead of learning four different interfaces, MCP standardizes communication so you can swap tools without changing your workflow. This creates composability—you can use the best features of different agents without being locked into one platform's ecosystem."
    },
    {
      question: "An organization has strict data privacy requirements and cannot use cloud-based tools. Which AI coding agents from this chapter can they deploy on their own servers?",
      options: [
        "Claude Code and Gemini CLI both support on-premise deployment options",
        "OpenAI Codex allows custom infrastructure but requires cloud connectivity",
        "Only Qwen Code due to its open-source Apache 2.0 license",
        "None of the agents support on-premise deployment options whatsoever"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The Qwen Code section explicitly describes on-premise deployment capability. The chapter states proprietary tools (Claude, Gemini, OpenAI) 'require cloud access.' Only Qwen Code, being fully open-source under Apache 2.0, can be deployed on private infrastructure with no external connectivity. This is a critical differentiator for organizations with strict data governance or compliance requirements that prohibit cloud-based tools."
    },
    {
      question: "What does the shift from 'autocomplete tools' to 'autonomous agents' mean for developers' roles?",
      options: [
        "Developers become less important as AI handles all coding tasks",
        "Developers spend more time on tedious mechanical tasks like naming variables",
        "Developers focus more on judgment architecture and complex problem-solving",
        "The orchestrator role requires significantly less skill than traditional coding"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The chapter explains: 'You get to do the creative, high-leverage work... The tedious parts... move to the AI.' This shift moves developers from mechanics to orchestration. The chapter emphasizes this is 'better'—you spend less time on boilerplate and more on the problems that require human judgment. This doesn't reduce skill requirements; it raises them because orchestration requires understanding what AI can and can't do well."
    },
    {
      question: "According to the chapter's evidence, why is the question 'Do you use AI in development?' outdated by 2025?",
      options: [
        "AI tools don't exist yet so the question is irrelevant now",
        "With 84% developer and 95% organizational adoption the question is 'How do you use AI?' now",
        "Only beginners use AI tools in development today professionally",
        "AI is used only for learning not for professional development work"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The chapter explicitly states: 'The question isn't whether you use AI in development anymore. The question is how.' This reflects the 84% developer adoption and 95% organizational adoption rates making AI universal infrastructure. At these adoption levels, not using AI has become the outlier position that needs explaining. The paradigm shift is from 'if' to 'how'—choosing appropriate tools and practices for your context."
    },
    {
      question: "The chapter references Benchmark Improvements showing GDPval performance increased from 13.7% to 40.6%. Why does this represent more than incremental improvement?",
      options: [
        "Any performance improvement is equally significant regardless of magnitude",
        "It demonstrates a step-change where AI moved from pattern-matching to handling novel problems",
        "Benchmark scores don't matter only real-world impact counts significantly",
        "This level of improvement is typical for annual AI model updates"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The chapter states: 'A near-tripling of performance... represents a step change... We've moved past the phase where AI was good at pattern matching... into territory where AI can handle novel problems.' From 13.7% to 40.6% is not incremental—it's nearly a 3x improvement showing qualitative difference in capability. This demonstrates genuine progress in AI reasoning and problem-solving, not just marginal gains. This milestone signals AI has crossed a threshold in handling difficult code generation tasks."
    },
    {
      question: "A team debates using Spec-Driven Development for a regulatory compliance feature. Which factor from this chapter supports choosing SDD?",
      options: [
        "SDD creates unnecessary overhead for simple features overall",
        "Regulatory contexts require documentation and traceability that SDD enforces",
        "Regulatory requirements contradict SDD principles fundamentally overall",
        "SDD is only appropriate for internal tools not compliance features"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The context table explicitly places 'Regulatory/safety requirements' in the SDD column marked 'Required.' Compliance features need documented specifications and traceable design decisions—exactly what SDD provides through written specs, comprehensive tests, and deliberate architectural choices. This creates the audit trail and documentation regulatory bodies require. Production code with regulatory requirements is precisely where SDD transforms from optional to essential."
    },
    {
      question: "What trade-off exists between proprietary tools (Claude, Gemini, OpenAI) and open-source tools (Qwen)?",
      options: [
        "Proprietary tools are always more cost-effective overall",
        "Proprietary tools invest in cutting-edge models while open-source tools offer transparency and control",
        "Open-source tools are universally superior to proprietary solutions",
        "There are no meaningful differences between all the tools"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The open vs. proprietary section directly states: 'Proprietary... Cutting-edge models (they invest billions in R&D)... Open-Source... Full transparency (read the code)... Can customize and fine-tune... No vendor dependency.' These represent the core trade-offs: proprietary tools offer maximum power with minimum infrastructure overhead; open-source tools offer transparency, control, and customization at the cost of infrastructure management. Neither is universally 'better'—the choice depends on your priorities."
    },
    {
      question: "Consider the statement: 'With AI amplifying development practices, engineering discipline becomes less important.' Is this true according to the chapter's DORA analysis?",
      options: [
        "Yes AI removes the need for discipline entirely in all cases",
        "No good practices are MORE critical with AI because they multiply leverage",
        "Discipline matters equally whether AI is used or not at all",
        "The chapter doesn't address this relationship between discipline and AI"
      ],
      correctOption: 1,
      explanation: "The chapter explicitly states: 'The discipline becomes MORE critical with AI, not less... This is precisely when you need discipline most.' DORA research shows strong practices capture disproportionate value from AI because their testing and review processes multiply the leverage. A 10% improvement in test coverage saves one bug quarterly without AI, but ten bugs quarterly with AI. Discipline's ROI scales with AI's amplification factor."
    },
    {
      question: "After understanding inflection points, development patterns, DORA metrics, and tool options, what is the single most important insight about AI-driven development from this chapter?",
      options: [
        "AI is a replacement for developer skills and practices overall",
        "There is one 'best' AI tool that solves all development problems",
        "AI amplifies existing practices success requires combining strong discipline with AI tools",
        "Vibe coding should never be used under any circumstances whatsoever"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,
      explanation: "The entire chapter builds toward this insight: AI amplifies what you bring (Lesson 2), amplifies organizational capabilities both strengths and weaknesses (Lesson 3), and tool selection matters less than understanding discipline (Lesson 4). The core theme across all four lessons is that success requires combining strong practices WITH AI, not relying on AI alone. This understanding prepares you for the next chapter on Spec-Driven Development and practical implementation."
