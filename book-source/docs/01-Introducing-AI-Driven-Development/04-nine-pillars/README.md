# Chapter 4: The Nine Pillars of AI-Driven Development (AIDD)

You've learned about the AI revolution transforming software development. You've written your first AI-assisted program. Now it's time to understand the complete methodology that makes all this possible.

This chapter introduces **AI-Driven Development (AIDD)**â€”a specification-first methodology built on nine foundational pillars that work together as an integrated system.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll understand:

- **What AIDD is** and why it's more than just using AI tools
- **The nine pillars** that form the foundation of modern AI-augmented development
- **The M-Shaped Developer** profile enabled by these nine pillars
- **Why all nine matter** and the competitive implications of partial vs. complete adoption
- **Your roadmap** for the remaining 42 chapters of this book

## What's Next

After completing this chapter, you'll begin Part 2 where you'll master AI coding assistants hands-on, starting with Claude Code in Chapter 5.
