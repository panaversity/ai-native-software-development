## Pedagogical Compliance

### Domain Skills Applied

| Skill | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| **learning-objectives** | Each lesson has clear, Bloom's-aligned objectives |
| **concept-scaffolding** | Progressive build: emotion â†’ economics â†’ role â†’ opportunity |
| **code-example-generator** | N/A (Chapter 1 is conceptual, not code-focused) |
| **exercise-designer** | Reflection prompts, comprehension checks, self-assessments |
| **assessment-builder** | Formative assessments in each lesson + summative in README |
| **technical-clarity** | Grade 7 reading level, heavy definitions, accessible analogies |
| **book-scaffolding** | Establishes foundation for Parts 2-7 progression |
| **ai-augmented-teaching** | Frames AI as collaborator, emphasizes WITH vs. FROM learning |

---

## Constitution Alignment

### Core Principles Demonstrated

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Principle 1: AI-First Teaching** | Entire Chapter 5 dedicated to WITH vs. FROM learning model |
| **Principle 5: Progressive Complexity** | Scaffolded from emotional engagement â†’ economic reality â†’ role definition |
| **Principle 8: Inclusivity** | No gatekeeping, heavy scaffolding, analogies for accessibility |
| **Principle 9: Show-Then-Explain** | Examples before abstractions (vibe coding, $3T calculation, Cursor vs. Microsoft) |

## Next Steps for Human Reviewer

### Immediate Review Tasks

1. **Read through all 5 lessons sequentially** (15-20 minutes)
   - Check flow and pacing
   - Verify emotional impact and engagement
   - Confirm clarity and accessibility

2. **Validate grounding in context**
   - Cross-reference claims with `context/02_chap1_spec/readme.md`
   - Ensure no speculative or unsupported statements
   - Check that examples and data are accurately represented

3. **Assess domain skill application**
   - Review table in this summary
   - Confirm each skill is visibly demonstrated
   - Check quality of scaffolding and assessments

4. **Verify Constitution alignment**
   - Principles 1, 5, 8, 9 specifically
   - Check inclusivity and accessibility
   - Confirm Show-Then-Explain pattern

5. **Final proofreading pass**
   - Grammar, spelling, clarity
   - Consistent terminology
   - Navigation links functional

6. **Test assessments**
   - Try answering comprehension checks yourself
   - Verify answers are clear and complete
   - Check that reflection prompts invite genuine thought

### Approval Decision

**If all reviews pass:**
- Mark tasks T034-T039 as complete in tasks.md
- Consider Chapter 1 ready for publication
- Proceed to Chapter 2 planning/implementation

**If revisions needed:**
- Document specific issues in tasks.md
- Create revision tasks as needed
- Re-review after corrections

## Implementation Notes

### What Went Well

1. **Clear spec and plan**: The detailed plan.md made implementation straightforward
2. **Foundational assets**: Having examples and analogies prepared upfront ensured consistency
3. **Progressive structure**: The 5-lesson arc flows naturally from disruption to pedagogy
4. **Bloom's alignment**: Each lesson has clear, measurable learning objectives
5. **Assessment integration**: Formative and summative assessments naturally embedded

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Word count targets**: Actual counts significantly exceeded targets due to comprehensive treatmentâ€”may need adjustment in future chapters
2. **Code examples**: Chapter 1 is purely conceptualâ€”future chapters will need working code examples
3. **Visual diagrams**: Text-based representations used; future chapters may benefit from actual diagrams
