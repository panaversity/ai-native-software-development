Examples:
- Sarah (product manager turning idea into production in 2 weeks)
- Marcus (senior engineer discovering value in decision-making over typing)
- Brazil SaaS founder (solo founder, $15K MRR, 6 weeks build time)
- Doctor building medical software ($40K MRR in 6 months, considering full-time)

### 2. Historical Context and Patterns

**Before**: Assertions about disruption
**After**: Comparative analysis showing patterns

Examples:
- Retail disruption (Amazon garage → global giant)
- Photography disruption (Kodak bankruptcy, Instagram $1B acquisition)
- Mobile revolution (Nokia collapse, BlackBerry irrelevance, 8-year transformation)
