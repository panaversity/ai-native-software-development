# Part 3: Prompt & Context Engineering

**Chapters**: 4 | **Cognitive Load**: Moderate | **Scaffolding**: Heavy (2-3 review cycles expected)

## Purpose

Master AI communication and context management. Learn structured frameworks for writing effective prompts that get the results you want.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Part 3, you will:
- Write effective, specific prompts using structured frameworks
- Manage context windows and token budgets intelligently
- Work with multimodal inputs (text, images, video)
- Debug AI-generated code systematically
- Refine and iterate prompts based on output quality

## Chapters in This Part

10. **The Architect Toolkit: Prompting Foundations** — Prompt structure, clarity, specificity, good/bad examples
11. **Six-Part Prompting Framework** — Structured approach to crafting powerful prompts
12. **Multimodal and Advanced Input** — Images, videos, function calling, tool invocation
13. **Advanced Prompt Techniques** — Few-shot learning, chain-of-thought, prompt chaining

## How This Part Works

- **Heavy scaffolding**: Each framework is broken into digestible steps with examples
- **Moderate-high concept density**: 4-5 key concepts per chapter
- **Iterative learning**: Build frameworks gradually (foundations → advanced techniques)
- **Practical exercises**: Test your prompts and see the difference structured approaches make

## Prerequisites

- Complete **Part 1: Introducing AI-Driven Development** (foundational concepts)
- Complete **Part 2: AI Tool Landscape** (familiar with at least one tool)

## What Comes Next

After completing Part 3, you'll be ready for **Part 4: Modern Python with Type Hints**, where we apply your AI communication skills to write production-quality code.
