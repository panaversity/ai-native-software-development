# Part 7: MCP Fundamentals

**Chapters**: 3 | **Cognitive Load**: Moderate | **Scaffolding**: Light (1 review cycle expected)

## Purpose

Extend AI capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling standardized tool integration and custom server development.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Part 7, you will:
- Understand MCP architecture and standards
- Integrate existing MCP servers into applications
- Build custom MCP servers and tools
- Design tools that extend AI capabilities

## Chapters in This Part

30. **Introduction to Model Context Protocol** — MCP architecture, why standardization, ecosystem
31. **Integrating MCP into Your Applications** — Using existing MCP servers, configuration, invocation
32. **Building Custom MCP Servers** — Server development, tool definition, SDK usage, best practices

## How This Part Works

- **Light scaffolding**: Full independence; learn by building
- **Moderate concept density**: 4-5 key concepts per chapter
- **Protocol-focused**: Understanding standardization and interoperability
- **Final specialization**: The capstone of your learning journey

## Prerequisites

- Complete **Part 4: Modern Python with Type Hints** (production Python)
- Complete **Part 6: Agentic AI Fundamentals** (agent concepts)
- Comfortable with Parts 1-5 (all foundational material)

## Congratulations!

You've completed **CoLearning Python & Agentic AI: The AI-Driven Way**. You now have the skills to:
- Build AI-assisted Python applications
- Design and implement autonomous agents
- Extend AI capabilities through protocols
- Scale projects professionally with Spec-Kit methodology
- Collaborate effectively with AI systems

## What's Next?

Start building! The world needs more AI-driven applications. Take what you've learned and create something amazing.
