# Built-In Tools Deep Dive

## From Commands to Capabilities

You've mastered basic Gemini CLI commands in Lesson 4. Now it's time to unlock what makes Gemini CLI truly powerful: **built-in tools** that connect the AI to your actual development environment.

Think of basic commands as asking someone for advice. Built-in tools are like giving that person direct access to your workspace—they can read your files, fetch documentation, search for current information, and understand your shell environment. This transforms Gemini from a general chatbot into a context-aware development assistant.

In this lesson, you'll learn to use four powerful tools that extend Gemini CLI beyond simple text prompts: **File Operations**, **Web Fetching**, **Search Grounding**, and **Shell Integration**. By the end, you'll combine these tools in realistic development workflows.

---

## Why Built-In Tools Matter

A standard AI chat interface operates in isolation. You copy-paste code, describe your file structure, manually fetch documentation. The AI sees only what you explicitly provide.

Gemini CLI's built-in tools eliminate this friction. They let Gemini:
- **Access your actual files** without copy-pasting
- **Fetch current web content** for real-time information
- **Ground responses in search results** for accuracy and citations
- **Understand your shell environment** to suggest relevant commands

This turns Gemini from a generic chatbot into a **context-aware development assistant** that understands your project's reality, not just what you tell it about.

---

## Tool 1: File Operations

### What It Does

The file operations tool lets Gemini read and analyze files on your system. Point Gemini directly to a file instead of copying code into the terminal. This is invaluable for code review, debugging, learning from examples, and understanding unfamiliar codebases.

### Syntax

```bash
gemini --file <path-to-file> "<your-question>"
```

### Example: Code Review

```bash
gemini --file ./my_function.py "Review this code for readability and potential bugs. Suggest improvements."
```

**What Gemini might find:**
- Missing type hints
- Potential KeyError from unchecked dictionary access
- Unused variables
- Opportunities for Python idioms (list comprehensions, `str.join()`, etc.)

### Use Cases

- **Code review**: Get feedback before committing
- **Debugging**: Share a problematic function for analysis
- **Learning**: Understand how experienced developers solve problems
- **Refactoring**: Identify improvement opportunities

### Exercise: Analyze Your Code

**Step 1**: Create a Python file with this code:
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for n in numbers:
        total = total + n
    return total / len(numbers)

result = calculate_average([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(result)
```

**Step 2**: Run Gemini analysis:
```bash
gemini --file ./example.py "Review this code. What Python best practices am I missing? Provide improved version."
```

**Expected improvements**: Use `sum()`, add type hints, handle empty list case.

---

## Tool 2: Web Fetching

### What It Does

Web fetching lets Gemini retrieve content directly from URLs and analyze it. Instead of searching Google, opening a browser, and reading documentation separately, Gemini fetches the content and synthesizes it with your prompt.

### Syntax

```bash
gemini --web-fetch <url> "<your-question>"
```

### Example: Fetch Official Documentation

```bash
gemini --web-fetch "https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html" "Explain how asyncio tasks work. Can I run multiple tasks concurrently?"
```

Gemini fetches the official docs and explains the concepts in context with your question, saving you time reading the full documentation.

### Use Cases

- **Documentation lookup**: Get specific answers from official docs without browsing
- **Research**: Fetch and synthesize information from multiple sources
- **Learning**: Understand new frameworks by fetching tutorial content
- **Current information**: Access web content for real-time information

### Exercise: Fetch and Analyze

**Task**: Fetch documentation and ask Gemini for focused analysis.

```bash
gemini --web-fetch "https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html" "I need to serialize complex Python objects to JSON. What approach should I use? Show me a code example."
```

**Success indicator**: You receive a focused answer based on actual web content, without reading the full documentation yourself.

## Tool 3: Search Grounding

### What It Does

Search grounding connects Gemini to Google Search, allowing it to provide current information with proper citations. This is crucial for questions about recent events, latest library versions, updated best practices, or any information that changes over time.

### How to Use

Gemini automatically triggers search grounding when it detects a question requires current information. You can also request it explicitly:

```bash
gemini "What are the latest Python 3.13 features?"
```

Or more explicitly:

```bash
gemini "search: current FastAPI best practices 2024"
```

### What You Get

Responses include citations like:
- `[Source: Python.org, 2024]`
- `[via Google Search - Real Python article]`

### Examples

**Current versions:**
```bash
gemini "What's the latest version of FastAPI and what major features were added?"
```

**Best practices over time:**
```bash
gemini "What are the current best practices for Python package management in 2024?"
```

**Recent changes:**
```bash
gemini "Has numpy changed how they handle type hints? What's current?"
```

### Important: Verify Critical Information

Search grounding improves accuracy for current information, but it's not perfect:
- Google Search results are generally reliable, but individual articles can contain errors
- Always verify critical information independently
- Gemini provides source links—fact-check directly
- Use search grounding for factual questions; not suitable for subjective opinions

### Exercise: Ask a Time-Sensitive Question

```bash
gemini "What were the major changes in Python 3.13? What's new that I should know about?"
```

**Verify**: Does Gemini cite specific sources? Can you see the citations? Does the information include specific version numbers and dates?

---

## Tool 4: Shell Integration

### What It Does

Shell integration lets you ask Gemini about command-line commands. It provides explanations, syntax help, and safety considerations. This is invaluable when you want to understand what a command does before running it, or when you need help constructing complex shell operations.

### How to Use

Ask Gemini naturally about shell commands:

```bash
gemini "How do I find all Python files in my project directory?"
```

**Gemini suggests:**
```
You can use find:
  find . -name "*.py"

This starts in current directory (.), searches for files matching pattern (*.py), and returns all matches.
```

### Examples

**Command explanation:**
```bash
gemini "What does this command do? git rebase --interactive HEAD~3"
```

**Constructing complex commands:**
```bash
gemini "I need to find all .py files modified in the last 7 days. What command?"
```

**Safety verification:**
```bash
gemini "I saw this command online: rm -rf /tmp/* — should I run it? Is it safe?"
```

### Use Cases

- **Learning shell syntax**: Understand what commands do
- **Command construction**: Build complex commands without memorizing syntax
- **Safety verification**: Understand what a command does before running it
- **Troubleshooting**: Get help when a command fails

### Exercise: Get Shell Command Help

```bash
gemini "I need to list all files in my src/ directory that are larger than 100KB. What command should I use?"
```

**Verify**: Does Gemini's explanation make sense? Do the flags/syntax look correct? Would you be confident running this?

## Combining Tools: A Realistic Workflow

Now let's see how professionals combine these tools. Here's a realistic scenario:

**Scenario**: You're learning FastAPI and want to build an async API.

### Step-by-Step Workflow

**Step 1: Fetch Official Documentation**
```bash
gemini --web-fetch "https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/concepts/" "What are the best practices for production deployment of FastAPI apps?"
```
(Saves you 10 minutes of reading)

**Step 2: Analyze Your Example Code**
```bash
gemini --file ./my_fastapi_app.py "Compare my code to FastAPI patterns. What am I doing well? What should I improve for production?"
```
(Gets focused feedback on YOUR code, not generic examples)

**Step 3: Get Current Best Practices**
```bash
gemini "search: FastAPI async best practices 2024 production performance"
```
(Ensures you're not following outdated guidance)

**Step 4: Understand Your Deployment Command**
```bash
gemini "I need to deploy with: gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker my_app:app — what does each flag do? Is this production-ready?"
```
(Verification before production)

### Exercise: Build Your Own Workflow

**Scenario**: You're refactoring a Python project to use type hints properly.

**Step 1: Get current guidance**
```bash
gemini "search: Python type hints best practices 2024"
```

**Step 2: Analyze your actual code**
```bash
gemini --file ./main.py "Review my code for type hint completeness. What types am I missing?"
```

**Step 3: Set up type checking**
```bash
gemini "I want to add mypy to my project. What's the current recommended way to set up mypy? What command should I run?"
```

**Reflection**: What did you accomplish without opening a browser or switching windows?

## Tool Limitations and Constraints

Understanding limitations makes you a better Gemini CLI user.

### File Size Limits
- **Practical limit**: Most systems handle files up to a few MB
- **Very large files**: Extract relevant sections rather than sharing entire large files
- **Workaround**: Share specific functions or sections

### Web Fetching Constraints
- **Some sites block automated access**: Paywalls, social media, some corporate sites
- **Dynamic content**: JavaScript-loaded pages may not be fully fetched
- **Large pages**: May be truncated
- **Workaround**: Copy relevant content manually or use simpler URLs

### Search Grounding Accuracy
- **Not fact-checking**: Search results can contain misinformation
- **Always verify**: Critical information (security, legal, health) should be verified independently
- **No opinion questions**: Works for factual questions, not subjective ones
- **Bias**: Search results reflect current internet trends

### When Tools Don't Help
- **Very new information**: Breaking news from last few hours may not be indexed
- **Local/proprietary systems**: Can't access internal company networks or databases
- **Real-time data**: Tools fetch snapshots, not live data
- **Subjective decisions**: Tools explain tradeoffs, but decisions are yours

## Key Takeaways

| Tool | Use For | Syntax | Key Limitation |
|------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| **File Operations** | Analyze local code/docs | `gemini --file <path> "<question>"` | File size limits (few MB) |
| **Web Fetching** | Access documentation, articles | `gemini --web-fetch <url> "<question>"` | Some sites block access |
| **Search Grounding** | Current information, citations | `gemini "search: <query>"` | Verify critical info |
| **Shell Integration** | Command help, syntax | `gemini "how do I...?"` | Verify before running |
