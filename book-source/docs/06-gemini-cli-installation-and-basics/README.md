# Chapter 6: Gemini CLI—Installation and Basics

You've mastered Claude Code—the agentic AI phenomenon that transformed terminal-based development. Now it's time to expand your toolkit with Gemini CLI, Google's open-source answer that brings its own strategic advantages: massive context windows, built-in Google Search grounding, and a thriving extension ecosystem.

This chapter isn't about replacing Claude Code. It's about understanding **when to use each tool** and building the judgment to choose the right AI assistant for every development scenario you encounter.

Through six progressive lessons—from motivation through installation, authentication, first commands, built-in tools, and strategic comparison—you'll gain hands-on experience with Gemini CLI while developing a decision framework that serves you throughout your AI-augmented development career.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have two powerful AI development tools at your command, each suited to different workflows and challenges.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this chapter, you'll understand:

- **Why Gemini CLI matters in the AI tool landscape**: The three key differentiators (open source licensing, generous free tier, 1 million token context window), how Google's response to Claude Code demonstrates rapid AI tool evolution, the strategic value of open-source AI development tools, and when to choose Gemini CLI over proprietary alternatives

- **Platform-specific installation and verification**: Complete setup process for Windows (PowerShell and Command Prompt), macOS (npm and Homebrew options, M1/M2 guidance), and Linux (Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora coverage), troubleshooting 8-10 common installation failures, and verification that `gemini --version` confirms successful installation

- **Authentication with Google account and configuration**: OAuth authentication flow via browser, understanding free tier quotas (60 requests/minute, 1,000 requests/day), basic configuration customization (model selection, themes, vim mode), regional limitations and the Qwen Code alternative, and troubleshooting authentication failures

- **Your first Gemini CLI commands**: Basic command syntax and interactive mode, five verification commands demonstrating different capabilities, understanding the three command types (slash `/`, at `@`, passthrough `!`), interpreting AI responses with critical thinking, handling common errors, and fundamental prompting principles

- **Built-in tools for integrated workflows**: File operations (`@` commands) for code analysis and documentation understanding, web fetching for retrieving online content, Google Search grounding for current information with citations, shell integration (`!` commands) for executing system commands with AI guidance, combining multiple tools in realistic development workflows, and understanding tool limitations and security considerations

- **The 1 million token context window advantage**: Translating "1 million tokens" into practical development terms (~100,000 lines of code or entire small-to-medium projects), identifying when context window size matters versus when it's irrelevant, leveraging massive context for architecture analysis and cross-file refactoring, understanding Gemini CLI's extension ecosystem and the Model Context Protocol (MCP), comparing Gemini CLI and Claude Code across 8 critical dimensions, and applying a decision framework to choose the right tool for every scenario

## What's Next

After completing this chapter, continue to **Chapter 7: GitHub Copilot** where you'll explore IDE-integrated AI assistance. You'll learn how Copilot's real-time code completion and inline suggestions complement the CLI-based tools you've mastered in Chapters 5 and 6.

Then, **Chapter 8: Choosing the Right Tool** will synthesize everything you've learned, providing a unified framework for selecting the optimal AI development tool based on project constraints, workflow preferences, and specific task requirements.

You're not just learning tools—you're building strategic judgment about when and how to leverage AI assistance for maximum development effectiveness.
