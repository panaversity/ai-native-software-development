## Gemini CLI Extensions

### What Are Extensions?

**Gemini CLI Extensions** let you add custom capabilities to Gemini CLI. Think of them as plugins or add-ons that extend what Gemini can do beyond its built-in tools.

Extensions are conceptually similar to **Claude Code Agent Skills**—both allow you to connect AI assistants to external data sources, APIs, and specialized tools for domain-specific workflows.

### Why Extensions Matter

Built-in tools (file operations, web fetching, search, shell) are general-purpose and work for most development scenarios. But what if you need:
- Access to your company's internal documentation system
- Integration with your team's project management tools
- Connection to proprietary databases or APIs
- Custom workflows specific to your industry

**Extensions solve this problem.** They let you customize Gemini CLI for your unique environment without modifying the core tool.

---

### Example Extensions

**1. Database Integration Extension**
- **Purpose**: Connect Gemini to PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
- **Use Case**: "Show me all users who signed up last week"
- **How it works**: Gemini queries your database directly and returns formatted results
- **When to use**: Data analysis, debugging database issues, generating reports

**2. Jira/Project Management Extension**
- **Purpose**: Link Gemini to your task tracking system (Jira, Linear, Asana)
- **Use Case**: "What are my open high-priority bugs?"
- **How it works**: Gemini fetches and summarizes tickets from your project management tool
- **When to use**: Sprint planning, status updates, prioritization

**3. Custom API Extension**
- **Purpose**: Integrate with your company's internal APIs
- **Use Case**: "What's the current status of order #12345?"
- **How it works**: Gemini calls your API and formats the response in natural language
- **When to use**: Internal tools, proprietary systems, company-specific workflows

**4. Documentation Extension**
- **Purpose**: Access internal wikis, Confluence, Notion
- **Use Case**: "What's our deployment process for the production environment?"
- **How it works**: Gemini searches your company docs and provides step-by-step guidance
- **When to use**: Onboarding, compliance, knowledge retrieval

### How Extensions Work: The Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Extensions are built on the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**—an open standard for connecting AI models to external data sources and tools.

**Think of MCP as a universal adapter:**
- **USB** allows any device to connect to any computer through a standard interface
- **MCP** allows any tool or service to connect to any AI model through a standard interface

**Why MCP matters:**
- **Open standard**: Anyone can build extensions (not vendor-locked)
- **Interoperability**: Extensions work across different AI models that support MCP
- **Security**: Controlled access to external systems with proper authentication
- **Community**: Shared extensions benefit the entire ecosystem

### Browsing Available Extensions

Ready to explore what extensions are available?

**Step 1: Visit the Extensions Marketplace**

Navigate to the official Gemini CLI Extensions directory:
```
https://geminicli.com/extensions
```

**Step 2: Browse by Category**

Extensions are organized by use case:
- **Data & Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch
- **Project Management**: Jira, Linear, Asana, Trello, GitHub Issues
- **Documentation**: Confluence, Notion, Google Docs, Markdown wikis
- **APIs & Services**: Stripe, Twilio, SendGrid, custom REST APIs
- **Development Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GitHub Actions
- **Communication**: Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams

**Step 3: Read Extension Details**

Each extension listing includes:
- **Description**: What the extension does
- **Installation command**: How to install it
- **Configuration**: What credentials or setup is required
- **Usage examples**: Sample prompts that work with the extension
- **Compatibility**: Which Gemini CLI versions support it

---

### Installing an Extension (Example)

Let's walk through installing a hypothetical **PostgreSQL Extension** as an example.

**Step 1: Install the Extension**

```bash
gemini extension install @gemini/postgres
```

This downloads and installs the extension to your Gemini CLI environment.

**Step 2: Configure the Extension**

```bash
gemini extension configure postgres
```

You'll be prompted for:
- Database host and port
- Database name
- Username and password (or connection string)
- SSL settings (if needed)

The extension stores these credentials securely in your local configuration.

**Step 3: Verify Installation**

```bash
gemini extension list
```

**Expected output:**
```
Installed Extensions:
  - @gemini/postgres (v1.2.0) - PostgreSQL database integration
  - @gemini/github (v2.0.1) - GitHub repository access
  - @gemini/slack (v1.5.3) - Slack workspace integration
```

**Step 4: Use the Extension**

```bash
gemini "Show me all users who registered in the last 7 days. Include their email and signup source."
```

Gemini automatically detects that you have the PostgreSQL extension installed and queries your database:

```
Found 42 users registered in the last 7 days:

| Email | Signup Source | Date |
|-------|---------------|------|
| alice@example.com | Organic search | 2025-10-28 |
| bob@example.com | Referral | 2025-10-27 |
| ...
```

### Creating Your Own Extension (High-Level Overview)

**Note**: This is conceptual knowledge for understanding the ecosystem. Creating extensions is an advanced topic covered in later parts of the book.

**Step 1: Identify the Need**

What capability do you want to add? Examples:
- Connect to a proprietary internal API
- Access a custom database schema
- Integrate with a company-specific tool

**Step 2: Set Up MCP Development Environment**

```bash
npm install -g @mcp/cli
mcp init my-custom-extension
```

**Step 3: Define the Extension Interface**

```javascript
// extension.js
export default {
  name: "my-custom-extension",
  version: "1.0.0",
  capabilities: ["query", "update"],

  async query(prompt) {
    // Your logic to handle queries
    // Call your API, database, or service
    return response;
  }
}
```

**Step 4: Test Locally**

```bash
gemini extension load ./my-custom-extension
gemini "Test prompt that uses my extension"
```

**Step 5: Publish (Optional)**

```bash
mcp publish my-custom-extension
```

**Key Takeaway**: You don't need to understand the implementation details now. The important concept is that **Gemini CLI is extensible**, and you can customize it for your specific needs.

### When to Use Extensions vs. Built-In Tools

| Scenario | Use Built-In Tools | Use Extensions |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **General development tasks** | ✅ File ops, web fetch, search | - |
| **Public documentation** | ✅ Web fetch or search grounding | - |
| **Standard shell commands** | ✅ Shell integration | - |
| **Company-specific APIs** | - | ✅ Custom API extension |
| **Internal documentation** | - | ✅ Documentation extension |
| **Proprietary databases** | - | ✅ Database extension |
| **Project management tools** | - | ✅ PM tool extension |

**Rule of thumb**: If the information is public and doesn't require authentication, use built-in tools. If it requires credentials or is company-specific, create or install an extension.

---

### Extensions: Optional but Powerful

**Important**: Extensions are **not required** for productive use of Gemini CLI. The built-in tools handle the vast majority of development scenarios.

Extensions become valuable when:
- You work with proprietary systems
- Your team has specialized workflows
- You want to automate repetitive tasks with internal tools
- You need seamless integration with company infrastructure

**For now**: Focus on mastering built-in tools (Lessons 2-3). Explore extensions later when you encounter a specific need that built-in tools can't solve.

**Resources**:
- **Extensions Marketplace**: [https://geminicli.com/extensions](https://geminicli.com/extensions)
- **MCP Documentation**: [https://modelcontextprotocol.io/](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)
- **Extension Development Guide**: [https://geminicli.com/docs/extension-dev/](https://geminicli.com/docs/extension-dev/)

## Qwen Code: An Alternative Implementation

Because Gemini CLI is open source, developers can fork it and create their own versions. **Qwen Code** is the most popular fork.

### What Is Qwen Code?

**Qwen Code** is a fork of Gemini CLI that uses **Alibaba's Qwen language models** instead of Google's Gemini.

### Key Differences

| Feature | Gemini CLI | Qwen Code |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Model** | Gemini 2.5 Pro | Qwen Coder |
| **Free Tier** | 1,000 requests/day | **2,000 requests/day** |
| **Rate Limit** | 60 requests/min | 100 requests/min |
| **Regional Availability** | Some restrictions | Globally available |
| **Focus** | General purpose | Code-specialized |
| **Language Support** | Strong multilingual | Enhanced Chinese support |

### When to Consider Qwen Code

**Choose Qwen Code if:**
- You're hitting Gemini's 1,000 request/day limit frequently
- You're in a region where Gemini API is restricted
- You work with Chinese language codebases
- You want higher rate limits for free

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install -g @qwencode/cli
qwen auth login
```

**Usage is nearly identical:**
```bash
# Gemini
gemini "Explain async/await"

# Qwen
qwen "Explain async/await"
```
