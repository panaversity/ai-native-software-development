# Built-In Tools Deep Dive

## Opening: The Collaboration Shift

In Lesson 2, you authenticated Gemini CLI and sent your first prompt. Simple prompts work fine for general advice. But what if you want Gemini to understand your actual code, read current documentation, verify information, or help you construct the right command without memorizing syntax?

The answer is **built-in tools**—capabilities that connect Gemini to your real development environment. Instead of you copying files into chat or describing your problem in isolation, Gemini can directly read your code, fetch web pages, search for current information, and help you understand shell commands.

The key insight: **You don't memorize tool syntax. You ask Gemini to help, and the tool activates naturally.**

This lesson teaches you to collaborate with Gemini using four powerful tools. But more importantly, it teaches you how to **think about asking questions to AI**—a skill that amplifies all your other learning.

---

## Why Tools Matter: Context Changes Everything

Imagine debugging a complex function. A traditional workflow:

1. Copy function code into your editor
2. Describe the problem in chat
3. Chat AI suggests fixes
4. You manually test them
5. Repeat multiple times

**With Gemini CLI tools:**

1. Ask: "Gemini, debug my function" (point to file)
2. Gemini reads your *actual code*, not your description
3. Gemini suggests fixes with full context
4. One or two iterations instead of five

The difference? **Context.** When AI has access to your real files, current web information, and the ability to understand your shell environment, it stops being a general chatbot and becomes a *specific development partner* for your actual problem.

Let's see how.

---

## Tool 1: File Operations — Reading Your Code

### The Scenario

You've written a Python function. You want feedback before committing it, but you don't want to copy-paste into chat. You also want to see what a real developer would catch.

**The old way**: Copy code into chat, hope your description is clear enough.

**The AI-first way**: Ask Gemini to read your file directly.

### Discovery: Asking Naturally

Here's the starting point. You have a Python file at `./utils.py`:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for n in numbers:
        total = total + n
    return total / len(numbers)

result = calculate_average([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(result)
```

Your first instinct might be: *"How do I get Gemini to read this file?"*

**Don't memorize syntax. Ask Gemini:**

```bash
gemini "I have a Python file at ./utils.py. Can you read it and review the code?"
```

**What Gemini says:**
```
I can help! Use the --file flag to share your code with me:

gemini --file ./utils.py "Review this code for best practices."

This tells me to read the file directly. I'll then analyze it
in the context of your question.
```

**Notice**: You asked naturally. Gemini told you the syntax. That's the agent-native model.

### Refining the Request

Now you know the syntax. But your first attempt might be too vague:

```bash
gemini --file ./utils.py "Review this code."
```

**Gemini's response** might be brief. You want deeper feedback. So you **refine**:

```bash
gemini --file ./utils.py "Review this code for: 1) Best practices, 2) Performance, 3) Error handling, 4) Type safety. What am I missing?"
```

**Better response**: Gemini now understands exactly what you need. It identifies:
- Missing type hints (`def calculate_average(numbers: list[float]) -> float:`)
- Error case: division by zero if empty list
- Opportunity: use built-in `sum()` instead of loop
- Why it matters: readability and maintainability

#### Learning to Learn with AI: How Specificity Improves Answers

Notice what happened:
- **Vague prompt**: "Review this code" → Shallow feedback
- **Specific prompt**: "Review for these 4 things" → Targeted, actionable feedback

**Why?** AI responds to clarity. When you name what you need, AI delivers that. When you're vague, AI guesses what matters.

**Skill to develop**: Before asking Gemini, ask yourself: *What specifically do I want to improve?*

---

### Exercise 1: Code Review Through Dialogue

**Your task**: Create a file with a function that has intentional flaws, then guide Gemini to identify them.

**Step 1: Create a file** (`my_function.py`):
```python
def process_data(data):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(data)):
        result.append(data[i] * 2)
    return result

user_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(process_data(user_data))
```

**Step 2: Start with a vague question:**
```bash
gemini --file ./my_function.py "What's wrong with this?"
```

**Step 3: Refine based on Gemini's response.** If Gemini mentions performance, ask:
```bash
gemini --file ./my_function.py "You mentioned performance. Show me a more Pythonic version. Explain why it's better."
```

**Step 4: Reflect in your notes:**
- What did Gemini catch that you missed?
- What made your refined prompt more effective than the vague one?
- What would you ask next?

---

### When to Use File Operations

**Perfect for:**
- Code review before committing
- Debugging: "Why does this crash?"
- Learning: "Show me idiomatic Python here"
- Refactoring: "What's the cleaner way?"

**Limitations:**
- File size: Generally works with files up to a few MB
- Binary files: Won't help with `.png`, `.pyc`, etc.
- Workaround: For large files, extract the relevant function and save it separately

---

## Tool 2: Web Fetching — Reading Current Documentation

### The Scenario

You're learning async Python. You want to understand how `asyncio.Task` works. You could:

1. Google "asyncio.Task"
2. Find the official Python docs
3. Read through the full page (5+ minutes)
4. Extract the relevant part
5. Ask ChatGPT about it

**With Gemini CLI's web fetching tool, you skip steps 2–4.**

### Discovery: From Search to Understanding

Your first thought: *"How do I fetch a webpage with Gemini?"*

**Ask naturally:**

```bash
gemini "Can you read a webpage and help me understand it?"
```

**Gemini responds:**
```
Yes! Use --web-fetch:

gemini --web-fetch "https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html" \
  "Explain asyncio.Task. Can multiple tasks run concurrently?"

This fetches the page and answers your question based on its content.
```

### Starting Vague, Then Refining

**First attempt (too broad):**
```bash
gemini --web-fetch "https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html" "Explain this page."
```

**Result**: You get a summary of the whole asyncio module—too much.

**Refined attempt (specific intent):**
```bash
gemini --web-fetch "https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html" \
  "I need to run 3 API requests concurrently. Should I use Task or gather()? Show me a code example."
```

**Result**: Gemini reads the docs and gives you a focused answer with example code. Much better.

#### Learning to Learn with AI: Making Documentation Personal

Traditional docs reading:
- Read entire page
- Hope it answers your question
- Feel like you wasted time on irrelevant sections

**With Gemini + web fetch:**
- Fetch the page
- Ask your *specific question*
- Get a personalized explanation

**The mindset shift**: You're not reading documentation. You're having a conversation *with* the documentation. Gemini is the intermediary.

---

### Exercise 2: Fetch and Question

**Your task**: Use web fetching to learn something specific you're uncertain about.

**Step 1: Identify a real question.** Examples:
- "How do I serialize custom Python objects to JSON?"
- "What's the difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`?"
- "How do type hints work with function overloads?"

**Step 2: Find the official documentation URL.** (Use Google for this one time.)

**Step 3: Ask Gemini to fetch and explain:**
```bash
gemini --web-fetch "<your-url>" "I need to <your-specific-goal>. Show me how with a code example."
```

**Step 4: If the answer isn't specific enough, refine:**
```bash
gemini --web-fetch "<your-url>" "The previous answer was too broad. Focus specifically on <narrower-goal>. Show a minimal example."
```

**Reflection:**
- Did fetching the docs save you time compared to reading them yourself?
- What made your question specific enough to get useful results?
- When would this be better/worse than web search?

---

### When to Use Web Fetching

**Perfect for:**
- Official documentation: Python, FastAPI, NumPy, etc.
- Technical articles: Real Python, Medium posts, DEV articles
- Learning specific frameworks: Fetch tutorials, then ask focused questions
- Resolving confusion: Fetch docs, ask Gemini to clarify the section that confused you

**Limitations:**
- Some sites block automated access (paywalls, social media)
- Dynamic content (JavaScript-loaded pages): May not fetch fully
- Large pages: May be truncated
- Workaround: Copy-paste relevant sections if fetch doesn't work

---

## Tool 3: Search Grounding — Current Information with Citations

### The Scenario

You're building a new project in 2024. You want to know about the latest Python features, FastAPI best practices, or whether NumPy changed something important. You don't want outdated information.

**The problem with generic AI**: It has a knowledge cutoff. Responses might be months or years old.

**Search grounding**: Connects Gemini to Google Search, so responses include current information with citations.

### How It Works (Almost Automatic)

You mostly don't need to do anything special. **Gemini automatically uses search** when it detects your question is about:
- Current information (latest library versions, recent changes)
- Events, news, or recent developments
- Best practices that evolve over time

You just ask naturally:

```bash
gemini "What are the latest Python 3.13 features I should know about?"
```

**Behind the scenes**: Gemini searches the web, reads recent articles, and grounds its response in current information.

**You see citations:**
```
According to the Python 3.13 release notes [Python.org, 2024]:
- Performance improvements with "Zero-cost Exceptions"
- Better error messages...

[Source: Python Enhancement Proposals]
```

### Requesting Search Explicitly

If Gemini doesn't automatically search, you can request it:

```bash
gemini "search: FastAPI best practices 2024 production performance"
```

The `search:` prefix tells Gemini: *"Use Google Search for this one."*

#### Learning to Learn with AI: Citations Are Your Verification Tool

When Gemini provides citations, **you have a way to verify**. This is important:

- Find the source link in Gemini's response
- Click it to read the original
- Verify the claim matches the source

**Why verify?** AI can misinterpret sources. Citations let you fact-check quickly.

---

### Exercise 3: Ask for Current Information, Then Verify

**Your task**: Ask Gemini a time-sensitive question, get citations, and verify one claim.

**Step 1: Ask about something recent:**
```bash
gemini "What are the major new features in the latest version of <your-favorite-library>? What changed from the previous version?"
```

**Step 2: Examine Gemini's response.** It should include citations like:
- `[Source: Library.org, 2024]`
- `[via GitHub Release Notes]`

**Step 3: Pick one claim and verify it.** Use the citation to find the source and confirm Gemini's statement is accurate.

**Reflection:**
- Did Gemini's citations help you verify quickly?
- Did you find any claims that didn't match the source?
- When would search grounding be most valuable for your work?

---

### When to Use Search Grounding

**Perfect for:**
- Current library versions and features
- Recent best practices (changes over time)
- New frameworks or tools
- Verifying whether something changed recently

**Limitations:**
- Not fact-checking machine: Can misinterpret search results
- Always verify critical information independently
- Not for subjective opinions (search results won't help)
- Slower than non-search queries (network latency)

---

## Tool 4: Shell Integration — Understanding Commands Without Memorizing

### The Scenario

You see a command online:
```bash
find . -name "*.py" -mtime -7 -exec wc -l {} \;
```

What does this do? You could:

1. Open a bash manual
2. Look up each flag individually
3. Guess based on pattern matching
4. Or: **Ask Gemini**

### Discovery: Asking About Commands

Your natural question:

```bash
gemini "What does this command do? find . -name '*.py' -mtime -7 -exec wc -l {} \;"
```

**Gemini explains:**
```
This command finds Python files modified in the last 7 days
and shows their line counts:

- find . : Start in current directory
- -name "*.py" : Match .py files only
- -mtime -7 : Modified within last 7 days
- -exec wc -l {} \; : Count lines in each file

Example output:
  42 file1.py
  156 file2.py
```

**Notice**: You didn't memorize flags. You asked. Gemini explained.

### Building Commands With Dialogue

You want a similar command but different:

**Your intent**: *Find all `.js` files larger than 100KB.*

**First attempt (vague):**
```bash
gemini "Show me a find command for large JavaScript files."
```

**Gemini suggests:**
```bash
find . -name "*.js" -size +100k
```

**Follow-up (refining):**
```bash
gemini "How do I modify this to also show file sizes in the output?"
```

**Gemini shows:**
```bash
find . -name "*.js" -size +100k -exec ls -lh {} \;
```

**You never memorized the syntax. You collaborated to build it.**

#### Learning to Learn with AI: Commands Are Conversations, Not Memorization

Traditional learning: memorize `man find`, study pages of flags.

**Agent-native learning**: Describe what you want, Gemini tells you how. Then refine.

**The skill**: Get comfortable describing intent clearly. Gemini handles the syntax.

---

### Exercise 4: Build a Command Through Dialogue

**Your task**: Create a command you want to run by asking Gemini step-by-step.

**Real scenario**: You want to find all Python files in your project, exclude test files, and count total lines of code.

**Step 1: State your goal clearly:**
```bash
gemini "I want to find all Python files in my project except test files, and count the total lines of code. What command?"
```

**Gemini suggests something like:**
```bash
find . -name "*.py" ! -path "*/test*" -exec wc -l {} + | tail -1
```

**Step 2: Understand each part:**
```bash
gemini "Explain each part of this command: find . -name '*.py' ! -path '*/test*' -exec wc -l {} + | tail -1"
```

**Step 3: Before running, verify safety:**
```bash
gemini "Is this command safe to run? Does it modify files? Could it cause problems?"
```

**Step 4: Run it (once you're confident), and if it fails:**
```bash
gemini "This command failed with: <error-message>. What went wrong?"
```

**Reflection:**
- Did this approach feel faster than reading man pages?
- What made the command explanation clear?
- When would you still consult manual pages instead of asking Gemini?

---

### When to Use Shell Integration

**Perfect for:**
- Understanding what a command does before running it
- Building complex commands without memorizing flags
- Debugging command failures
- Learning shell patterns

**Limitations:**
- Always verify before running commands that modify files
- Some edge cases: Gemini might suggest syntax that fails on your shell
- Real-time command execution: Gemini explains, you verify before running

---

## Combining Tools: A Real Development Workflow

Let's see how professionals combine these tools to solve problems faster.

### Scenario: Building a Production-Ready FastAPI Application

You're starting a new FastAPI project. You want to:
1. Understand current best practices
2. Review your starter code
3. Set up proper testing
4. Deploy it safely

Here's how you'd collaborate with Gemini:

**Step 1: Fetch Current Best Practices**

```bash
gemini --web-fetch "https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/deployment/concepts/" \
  "What are the key best practices for production FastAPI deployment?"
```

**Result**: You understand production requirements (async handling, load balancing, security) without reading the full deployment guide.

**Step 2: Analyze Your Code**

```bash
gemini --file ./main.py \
  "Compare my FastAPI app to production best practices. What am I doing well? What risks do I have?"
```

**Result**: Gemini finds specific issues (unvalidated inputs, missing error handlers) in your actual code.

**Step 3: Get Current Testing Practices**

```bash
gemini "search: FastAPI pytest best practices 2024"
```

**Result**: You learn about recent testing improvements, including the latest pytest features.

**Step 4: Understand Your Deployment Setup**

```bash
gemini "I'll deploy with: docker run -e DB_URL=postgres://... my_app:latest. \
What should I check before this goes live?"
```

**Result**: Gemini identifies security issues (hardcoded DB URL, missing secrets management) before you hit production.

**Total time**: 15 minutes instead of 1–2 hours of reading, context-switching, and searching.

### Exercise 5: Build Your Own Workflow

**Choose a real problem you're facing**: Debugging, learning a new tool, refactoring code, understanding a framework.

**Use these steps:**

1. **Get context**: Use web fetching to understand best practices or current approaches
2. **Analyze your code**: Use file operations to review your actual implementation
3. **Verify currency**: Use search grounding to ensure you're not following outdated patterns
4. **Ask about commands**: Use shell integration to understand or build what you need

**Document your workflow:**
- What tools did you use?
- How much time did this save compared to traditional methods?
- What would you do differently next time?

---

## Understanding Limitations (The Real Story)

Powerful tools have constraints. Knowing them prevents frustration.

### File Operations Limits

- **Size**: Works smoothly with files up to ~5 MB. Larger files may be truncated.
- **Binary files**: Can't analyze `.exe`, `.pyc`, images, etc.
- **Solution**: Extract relevant code sections into a separate file for analysis

**Realistic scenario:**
```bash
gemini --file ./app.py "Review this file."  # Works
gemini --file ./large_dataset.csv "Analyze this."  # May fail or truncate
# Instead:
head -100 large_dataset.csv > sample.csv
gemini --file ./sample.csv "Analyze this sample."  # Works
```

### Web Fetching Limits

- **Blocked sites**: Some URLs block automated access (paywalls, social media, corporate intranets)
- **JavaScript-heavy pages**: Content loaded by JavaScript may not fetch
- **Timeouts**: Very large pages may time out
- **Solution**: Copy-paste relevant sections if fetch fails

**Realistic scenario:**
```bash
# Fails (Medium blocks automated access):
gemini --web-fetch "https://medium.com/..." "Summarize this article."

# Works (GitHub is automation-friendly):
gemini --web-fetch "https://github.com/.../releases" "What's new?"
```

### Search Grounding Limits

- **Not fact-checking**: Search results can contain errors
- **Recent news**: Breaking news from the last few hours may not be indexed
- **Subjective questions**: Search won't resolve opinion-based questions
- **Solution**: Always verify critical claims independently

**Realistic scenario:**
```bash
gemini "search: Is Docker a good choice for this project?"  # Opinion—not helped by search

gemini "search: Docker latest version features"  # Factual—search helps
```

### Shell Integration Limits

- **Shell differences**: Syntax varies between bash, zsh, PowerShell, etc.
- **Edge cases**: Complex commands may have subtle failures on your system
- **Solution**: Always test in a safe directory first; ask Gemini to explain before running

**Realistic scenario:**
```bash
# Gemini suggests: rm -rf old_backup/
# Before running, ask:
gemini "Is this safe? Will it delete everything in old_backup/?"
# Verify Gemini confirms, then run
```

---

## Putting It Together: The Agent-Native Mindset

Throughout this lesson, you've seen a pattern:

1. **Start with your goal**, not syntax
2. **Ask Gemini naturally**
3. **Get back a suggestion**
4. **Refine based on feedback**
5. **Learn in the process**

This is fundamentally different from traditional learning:

| Traditional | Agent-Native |
|---|---|
| Memorize syntax first | Ask naturally first |
| Read full documentation | Fetch relevant sections |
| Search for answers | Leverage search grounding |
| Look up man pages | Ask Gemini to explain |
| Trial-and-error | Dialogue with AI |

**The meta-skill you've developed:** *Asking good questions is more valuable than remembering answers.*

When you can describe what you want clearly, AI handles the syntax, documentation, and technical details. Your job: clarify intent, refine based on feedback, and think critically about suggestions.

---

## Try With AI: Apply All Four Tools to a Real Scenario

Now it's your turn. You'll use all four tools together to solve a realistic development problem.

### Setup

We'll use **Gemini CLI** (which you installed in Lesson 2). If you haven't already set it up, go back and authenticate.

If you prefer a web interface, **ChatGPT** works for all these examples—you'll just type the prompts into chat instead of using the command line.

### Scenario: Optimize a Python Script

You have a script that's slow and you want to make it faster. The workflow below combines all four tools.

### Prompt Set (Progressive Complexity)

#### Prompt 1: Get Context (Web Fetching)
Start by understanding current best practices for Python performance optimization:

**Gemini CLI:**
```bash
gemini --web-fetch "https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html" \
  "How do I benchmark Python code to measure performance improvements? Show a simple example."
```

**ChatGPT (web):** Copy the prompt above into chat.

**Expected outcome:** You understand how to measure performance (using `timeit` or similar), so you know whether your optimizations actually help.

---

#### Prompt 2: Analyze Your Code (File Operations)
Now let's look at the actual script. Create a file called `slow_script.py`:

```python
def process_data(data):
    results = []
    for item in data:
        if item % 2 == 0:
            results.append(item * 2)
    return results

data = list(range(1000000))
output = process_data(data)
print(len(output))
```

**Gemini CLI:**
```bash
gemini --file ./slow_script.py \
  "This script is slow. What's the bottleneck? How would you optimize it for speed?"
```

**ChatGPT (web):** Paste the script into chat with the same question.

**Expected outcome:** Gemini identifies opportunities (list comprehension instead of append loop, potential NumPy use for large datasets). You get concrete suggestions with reasoning.

---

#### Prompt 3: Learn Current Techniques (Search Grounding)
Search for modern optimization techniques:

**Gemini CLI:**
```bash
gemini "search: Python performance optimization 2024 list comprehension vs generator vs numpy"
```

**ChatGPT (web):** Type the prompt and let ChatGPT search for recent information.

**Expected outcome:** You see which techniques are current best practices, with references to recent articles and documentation.

---

#### Prompt 4: Build the Optimized Version (Dialogue)
Now refine your approach with Gemini:

**Gemini CLI:**
```bash
gemini --file ./slow_script.py \
  "Rewrite this function using a list comprehension instead of a loop. Explain the performance difference."
```

**ChatGPT (web):** Paste the script and ask the same.

**Expected outcome:** You get an optimized version with explanation. You understand *why* it's faster (fewer function calls, simpler bytecode).

---

#### Prompt 5: Verify and Understand Commands (Shell Integration)
If you want to benchmark both versions:

**Gemini CLI:**
```bash
gemini "How do I run a Python script and measure its execution time on the command line?"
```

**ChatGPT (web):** Type the question.

**Expected outcome:** You learn `time ./slow_script.py` or `python -m timeit` without memorizing syntax.

---

### Expected Outcomes

After these five prompts, you should have:

1. ✅ Understanding of how to benchmark code
2. ✅ Specific optimizations for your script
3. ✅ Knowledge of current best practices
4. ✅ An optimized version of your code
5. ✅ A way to verify the improvements

**Key insight**: You solved a real problem (slow script) using all four tools in sequence. The entire workflow took ~10 minutes. Without AI collaboration, it would take 45+ minutes of reading documentation, searching for examples, and trial-and-error.

---

### Safety & Ethics Note: Trust But Verify

Gemini's suggestions are helpful, but you remain responsible:

- **Code quality**: Suggested code should be readable and maintainable, not just fast
- **Correctness**: Always test optimizations (did you break functionality?)
- **Security**: Don't optimize away error handling or security checks
- **Relevance**: Does the optimization actually solve your real problem?

**Before deploying**: Run the code, measure actual performance, and ask: *"Does this optimization matter for my use case?"*

---

### Next Variation (On Your Own)

Try this with a problem you're actually facing:

1. Fetch documentation related to your problem
2. Share your code with Gemini
3. Search for current best practices
4. Ask Gemini to help you understand a command or build one
5. Document what you learned and how long it took

Reflect: *How would this have gone without AI collaboration?*

---

## What You've Mastered

You've moved from "how do I use this tool?" to "how do I collaborate with AI to solve real problems?"

The four tools—file operations, web fetching, search grounding, shell integration—are capabilities. The real skill is *knowing when to ask and what to ask.*

**Looking ahead**: Lesson 4 explores **context windows**—how much information you can include in a single conversation with Gemini. You'll learn when Gemini CLI shines compared to other tools, and how to choose the right AI assistant for different scenarios.
