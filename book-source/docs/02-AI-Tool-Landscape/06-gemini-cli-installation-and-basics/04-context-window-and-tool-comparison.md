## The Question You're Probably Asking

You've learned about Gemini CLI. You've used ChatGPT or Claude before. Now you're wondering:

**"Which one should I use? Is Gemini better? When does it matter?"**

Here's the honest answer: **For most tasks, it doesn't matter.** But for some specific situations, choosing the right tool makes a huge difference.

This lesson teaches you how to ask your AI companion which tool to use for your specific situation. You won't memorize rules. You'll learn to consult AI about which AI to use—a meta-skill that works for any tool, current or future.

By the end, you'll confidently choose tools through dialogue, not guesswork.

## What Is a Context Window? (The Reading Capacity Analogy)

A **context window** is how much your AI can "see" and understand at once.

Think of it like your desk space:
- **Small desk** (ChatGPT, Claude): You can spread out 1-2 documents and read them thoroughly
- **Large desk** (Gemini CLI): You can spread out 10-20 documents and see them all simultaneously

**Key insight**: You don't need to understand the technical details. What matters is knowing when desk size helps.

### Simple Comparison

| Tool | Context Window | What This Means for Your Work |
|------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| **ChatGPT** | Medium (128K tokens) | Can read 1-2 full reports at once |
| **Claude Code** | Large (200K tokens) | Can read 2-4 full reports at once |
| **Gemini CLI** | Very Large (1M tokens) | Can read 10-20+ reports simultaneously |

**Translation**: Tokens ≈ Words. Roughly 750 words = 1,000 tokens.

**But here's the truth**: You don't calculate this. You ask your AI: "Can you handle this task?" It tells you.

---

## When Context Size Doesn't Matter (80% of Your Work)

Let's start with reality: **Most business tasks work fine with any AI tool.**

### Scenario 1: Single Document Review

You have one quarterly sales report (15 pages, ~7,500 words).

**Your task**: "Read this Q3 sales report and identify the top 3 revenue trends."

**Context needed**: Medium (one document)

**Which tools work**: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini CLI—all work equally well

**Why it doesn't matter**: Any tool can read one document fully. Choose based on what you already have access to.

---

### Scenario 2: Simple Research Question

You need to understand a business concept.

**Your question**: "What's the difference between Series A and Series B funding?"

**Context needed**: Almost none (general knowledge)

**Which tools work**: Any AI tool answers this identically

**Why it doesn't matter**: This is a knowledge question, not a document analysis task.

---

### Scenario 3: Quick Competitor Check

You want to know one competitor's pricing.

**Your task**: "Check Shopify's pricing and tell me their entry-level tier cost."

**Context needed**: Small (one webpage)

**Which tools work**: All of them can fetch and read one pricing page

**Why it doesn't matter**: Single-page tasks don't stress any tool's capacity.

---

### The Reality Check

**For 80% of daily business tasks**, context size is irrelevant:
- Reading one report
- Answering knowledge questions
- Checking one website
- Reviewing one contract
- Analyzing one data file

**Choose based on**:
- Cost (Gemini CLI has generous free tier)
- Interface (Do you prefer web or terminal?)
- What you already have access to

**Context size only matters for the other 20% of tasks.** Let's explore those.

---

## When Large Context Becomes Critical

Some business tasks require seeing multiple documents simultaneously. This is where tool choice matters.

### Scenario 1: Multi-Competitor Pricing Analysis

**Your situation**: You're pricing a new product. You need to compare 12 competitor pricing structures side-by-side.

**Traditional approach**:
1. Visit 12 websites manually
2. Take notes in a spreadsheet
3. Manually compare features and prices
4. Time: 2-3 hours

**With Small Context (ChatGPT)**:
- Ask: "Compare these 12 competitor pricing pages"
- AI reads them one-by-one
- You piece together the comparison
- Time: 45 minutes

**With Large Context (Gemini CLI)**:
- Ask: "Read all 12 competitor pricing pages and create a comparison table"
- AI sees all 12 simultaneously
- AI identifies patterns across all competitors
- AI creates comprehensive comparison
- Time: 10 minutes

**Why this matters**: Gemini sees all data at once and catches patterns you'd miss reading sequentially.

**How to ask Gemini**:
```
I need to compare pricing across 12 competitor websites for our new SaaS product.
Can you read all 12 at once and create a comparison table, or should I break this into smaller batches?
```

Gemini will tell you if it can handle all 12 (it can) and suggest the best approach.

---

### Scenario 2: Annual Business Review

**Your situation**: You have 12 monthly sales reports from 2024. You want to identify trends across the entire year.

**Traditional approach**:
- Read each month manually
- Note trends in each
- Try to remember patterns from January when reading December
- Miss connections between non-adjacent months

**With Small Context**:
- Feed reports quarterly (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
- Get 4 separate analyses
- Manually synthesize the year

**With Large Context (Gemini CLI)**:
- Upload all 12 months at once
- Ask: "Analyze trends across the entire year. Which products show seasonal patterns? What changed from January to December?"
- AI sees the full year simultaneously
- Identifies year-long patterns, seasonal effects, gradual trends

**Why this matters**: Some business insights only appear when you see the complete timeline.

**How to ask**:
```
I have 12 monthly sales reports (Excel files, roughly 50 pages each).
I want to identify trends across the entire year. Can you analyze all 12 together,
or should I group them by quarter?
```

---

### Scenario 3: Comprehensive Customer Feedback Analysis

**Your situation**: You collected 50 customer feedback emails during Q4. You want to identify the top 3 complaints and understand why customers are frustrated.

**Traditional approach**:
- Read all 50 emails manually
- Try to remember themes
- Count mentions manually
- Miss subtle connections

**With Small Context**:
- Feed emails in batches of 10
- Get 5 separate summaries
- Manually combine themes

**With Large Context (Gemini CLI)**:
- Give AI all 50 emails at once
- Ask: "Read all customer feedback and identify the top 3 complaints. For each complaint, show me 2-3 example quotes and suggest solutions."
- AI sees all feedback simultaneously
- Identifies true patterns (not just what appeared in first batch)
- Provides representative examples

**Why this matters**: Customer sentiment analysis requires seeing the full picture, not fragments.

---

### Scenario 4: Multi-Document Contract Comparison

**Your situation**: You're choosing between 5 different SaaS vendors. Each sent you a contract (~20 pages). You need to compare pricing terms, cancellation clauses, and data ownership across all 5.

**With Small Context**:
- Read contracts 1-2 at a time
- Create manual comparison notes
- Risk missing subtle differences

**With Large Context (Gemini CLI)**:
- Upload all 5 contracts
- Ask: "Compare these 5 vendor contracts. Create a table showing: monthly cost, cancellation terms, data ownership, and any red flags. Which vendor has the best terms for a small business?"
- AI reads all 5 simultaneously
- Catches inconsistencies across vendors
- Recommends best fit for your situation

---

## The Real Decision Framework: Ask AI

Here's the secret: **You don't memorize when to use which tool.** Instead, you ask.

### The Meta-Skill: Consulting AI About Tool Choice

When you're uncertain, describe your situation and ask.

**Example Dialogue 1: Competitor Research**

**You**: "I need to analyze 15 competitor websites to understand their pricing strategies, target customers, and key features. Should I use Gemini CLI or ChatGPT for this?"

**Your AI** (could be ChatGPT or Gemini):
"For analyzing 15 websites simultaneously:
- **Gemini CLI recommended**: Can read all 15 at once, identify cross-competitor patterns
- **ChatGPT approach**: Would need to read in batches of 2-3, requiring you to synthesize
- **Benefit of Gemini**: Complete view in one analysis; catches patterns across all competitors
- **Recommendation**: Use Gemini CLI for comprehensive competitor intelligence in one conversation."

---

**Example Dialogue 2: Monthly Reports**

**You**: "I have 6 months of financial reports (January-June). Each is about 30 pages. I want to understand cash flow trends. Which tool should I use?"

**Your AI**:
"6 months × 30 pages = ~180 pages total
- **ChatGPT**: Can handle this in 2-3 batches (60 pages each)
- **Gemini CLI**: Can see all 180 pages at once
- **For cash flow trends**: Large context helps because trends span months
- **Recommendation**: Gemini CLI gives you year-to-date view; ChatGPT requires quarterly synthesis
- **Budget consideration**: If on free tier, both work—Gemini just faster"

---

**Example Dialogue 3: Budget-Constrained Research**

**You**: "I'm on a tight budget. I need to read 30 customer survey responses to identify common themes. What's the most cost-effective approach?"

**Your AI**:
"30 survey responses (assume ~500 words each = ~15,000 words total)
- **Gemini CLI free tier**: 1,000 requests/day—this uses 1 request for all 30
- **ChatGPT free tier**: Works fine; might need 2-3 prompts if you want detailed analysis
- **Cost**: Both free tiers handle this easily
- **Recommendation**: Use whichever you have access to; Gemini is slightly faster (one prompt)"

---

### What You Learn From These Dialogues

- **AI evaluates YOUR specific situation** (not generic advice)
- **You get personalized recommendations** based on task size, budget, timeline
- **You don't memorize rules**; you consult AI each time
- **This works for future tools too**—same questioning approach applies

---

## Practice: Ask About Your Real Situation

Now it's your turn. Think of a real business task you're facing.

### Exercise 1: Describe Your Task and Ask

**Template**:
```
I need to [YOUR BUSINESS TASK] involving [NUMBER] of [DOCUMENTS/WEBSITES/FILES].
Should I use Gemini CLI, ChatGPT, or Claude for this? Why?
```

**Real Examples**:

```
I need to compare benefits packages from 8 different health insurance providers
to choose the best one for my startup. Should I use Gemini CLI, ChatGPT, or
Claude for this? Why?
```

```
I need to analyze 20 customer interview transcripts (each ~10 pages) to identify
product improvement opportunities. Should I use Gemini CLI, ChatGPT, or Claude
for this? Why?
```

```
I need to review 3 different vendor proposals (each ~15 pages) and create a
side-by-side comparison for my team. Should I use Gemini CLI, ChatGPT, or
Claude for this? Why?
```

**What to observe**:
- Does your AI recommend one tool over others?
- What reasoning does it give?
- Do the recommendations align with your budget, timeline, complexity?

**Write down the response.** This is your personalized decision framework.

---

### Exercise 2: Test with Varying Task Sizes

Ask about the same task at different scales:

**Small scale**:
```
I need to review 1 competitor's pricing page. Which tool should I use?
```

**Medium scale**:
```
I need to review 5 competitor pricing pages. Which tool should I use?
```

**Large scale**:
```
I need to review 20 competitor pricing pages. Which tool should I use?
```

**What you'll learn**: At what point does your AI recommend switching to larger-context tools?

---

## Understanding Tool Trade-Offs (Without Memorization)

You don't need to memorize comparison charts. But understanding the dimensions helps you ask better questions.

### Key Dimensions to Ask About

**1. Context Window**
- Ask: "Can you handle [X] documents at once?"
- AI tells you yes/no and suggests batching if needed

**2. Cost**
- Ask: "What's the most cost-effective tool for [MY TASK]?"
- AI considers free tiers, API pricing, your usage pattern

**3. Interface**
- Ask: "Do you work better in browser or terminal for [MY TASK]?"
- You already know your preference; verify compatibility

**4. Speed**
- Ask: "For analyzing 15 reports, which tool gives fastest results?"
- AI compares batch processing vs. single-pass analysis

**5. Output Format**
- Ask: "I need a comparison table. Which tool formats this best?"
- AI recommends based on output needs


---

## Key Insight: Asking Matters More Than Knowing

By now, you've learned:

1. **Context window = reading capacity** (how much AI can see at once)
2. **Most tasks don't need large context**—any tool works
3. **Multi-document tasks benefit from large context**—Gemini CLI's advantage
4. **Don't memorize tool charts**—ask AI to evaluate your situation
5. **AI can recommend itself or competitors**—honest evaluation

The meta-skill: **Consult your AI tools about which tool to use.**

This scales to any future tools. When GPT-5 arrives, when Claude expands, when new tools emerge—you'll know how to ask which fits your needs.

## Try With AI: Personalized Tool Selection

### Setup

Open any AI tool you have access to (Gemini CLI, ChatGPT, Claude). You'll ask it to help you choose the right tool for real tasks.

---

### Prompt 1: Multi-Competitor Analysis

```
I need to compare pricing, features, and customer reviews across 10 competitors
in the project management software space. Should I use Gemini CLI or ChatGPT
for this research? Explain which is better and why.
```

**Expected Outcome**: Your AI recommends a tool based on the task size (10 competitors) and explains whether you need large context or can batch the analysis.

---

### Prompt 2: Annual Report Synthesis

```
I have 12 monthly sales reports from 2024 (Excel files, roughly 40 pages each).
I want to identify revenue trends, seasonal patterns, and which products grew or
declined. Which tool should I use to analyze all 12 months together?
```

**Expected Outcome**: Your AI evaluates whether 12 × 40 pages fits in one analysis or needs batching, and recommends the most efficient approach.

---

### Prompt 3: Budget Consideration

```
I'm on a limited budget using free tiers only. I need to analyze 50 customer
feedback emails to find the top 3 complaints. Which tool is most cost-effective:
Gemini CLI (free tier: 1,000 req/day) or ChatGPT (free tier: limited usage)?
```

**Expected Outcome**: Your AI compares free tier limits against your task and recommends the most economical approach.

---

### Prompt 4: Complex Multi-Step Research

```
I need to:
1. Read 5 industry trend reports
2. Analyze our internal sales data from the past year
3. Compare to 8 competitor offerings
4. Identify market gaps we can fill

This is a multi-step research project. Which AI tool can handle this workflow
most efficiently?
```

**Expected Outcome**: Your AI recommends a tool based on the multi-document, multi-step nature of the task and suggests workflow optimizations.
