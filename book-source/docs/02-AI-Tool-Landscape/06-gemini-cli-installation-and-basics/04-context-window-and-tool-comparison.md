# Context Window & Tool Comparison

## Introduction: A Question You've Probably Had

You've been learning Gemini CLI. You've installed it, authenticated, run built-in tools, and seen it work. But somewhere in the back of your mind, a question emerges:

**"Is Gemini CLI better than Claude Code? When should I use one versus the other?"**

This lesson answers that question—but not by giving you a checklist to memorize. Instead, you'll learn how to ask AI itself to help you make the decision. This is a meta-skill: learning to consult your AI tools to evaluate which tool is best for your situation.

By the end of this lesson, you'll understand context windows, know how to ask Gemini about your specific project, and have a framework for making tool decisions through dialogue with AI.

---

## What Is a Context Window? (And Why You Might Not Need to Calculate It)

### The Simple Explanation

A **context window** is the amount of text an AI model can "see" and understand at once. Think of it like a reading window—the larger the window, the more of a document you can see simultaneously.

**Here's the key insight**: You don't need to understand token math to use context windows effectively. What matters is knowing when to ask.

### Context Windows: A Simple Comparison

| Tool | Context Window | What This Means |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Gemini CLI** | 1,000,000 tokens | Can see large projects at once |
| **Claude Code** | 200,000 tokens | Can see smaller projects at once |
| **ChatGPT-4** | 128,000 tokens | Can see medium files/docs at once |

**Key insight**: Gemini CLI can see about 5x more code than Claude Code in a single conversation.

### But Does Your Project Size Actually Matter?

Let's be honest: for most tasks, context window size is irrelevant. Let me show you when it matters and when it doesn't.

---

## Pause and Reflect: What's Your Situation?

Before we dive deeper, ask yourself:

- **What are you building?** (A single script? A web app? A large system?)
- **How big is your codebase?** (Rough estimate: 1 file? 10 files? 100+ files?)
- **What problem are you solving?** (Learning a concept? Fixing a bug? Refactoring? Analyzing an entire system?)

Keep your specific situation in mind as you read. We'll show you how to ask AI about your exact scenario.

---

## When Context Window Size Doesn't Matter

Let's start with the truth: **for most daily tasks, context size is irrelevant**.

### Scenario 1: Single File Bug Fixes

You're debugging a TypeError in your Python script.

```bash
gemini "I'm getting TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment. What does this mean?"
```

**Context needed**: Almost none. This is a concept question.

**Who can handle it**: Gemini CLI, Claude Code, ChatGPT—all identical.

---

### Scenario 2: Learning Concepts

You want to understand how Python decorators work.

```bash
gemini "Explain how Python decorators work. Show a practical example."
```

**Context needed**: None. You're learning a concept, not analyzing your code.

**Who can handle it**: Any AI tool works equally well.

---

### Scenario 3: Small Project Analysis

You have a personal project: 5 Python files, ~1,000 lines total.

```bash
gemini --file ./src/**/*.py "Review this code for security issues"
```

**Context needed**: ~5,000-10,000 tokens (small).

**Who can handle it**: Gemini CLI, Claude Code, ChatGPT—all work fine. You'll never hit context limits.

---

### The Reality Check

**For 80% of your daily work**, context window size won't matter. Both tools feel identical. Choose based on:
- **Cost**: Gemini CLI has a free tier (1,000 requests/day)
- **Interface**: Do you prefer web (Claude) or terminal (Gemini)?
- **Availability**: Which tool is accessible right now?

**Context size only becomes critical for the remaining 20% of tasks.** Let's explore those.

---

## When Context Size Becomes Critical

There are specific scenarios where a large context window changes everything.

### Scenario 1: Large Legacy Codebases

**Situation**: You're analyzing a mature project with 200+ files and 50,000+ lines of code spread across multiple modules.

**Your Question**:
> "I have a medium-sized Flask API with 40+ files, ~25,000 lines. Can I analyze the whole architecture at once, or should I break it into pieces?"

**How to Ask Gemini**:

```bash
gemini "I have a Flask API project with 40 files and approximately 25,000 lines of code spread across models, routes, services, and utilities. I want to analyze the entire authentication architecture across all modules at once. Will that fit in your context window?"
```

**What Gemini Tells You**:
- Yes, 25,000 lines easily fits in 1,000,000 tokens
- You can upload all 40 files at once
- You'll get a complete architectural analysis without missing cross-file dependencies

**Compare to Claude Code**: You'd need to upload files selectively, run multiple analyses, and manually piece together the architecture.

**Why it matters**: With large context, you see dependencies and patterns that span entire systems.

---

### Scenario 2: Entire Documentation Sets

**Situation**: You're learning a complex framework. You want to understand all the ways it handles asynchronous operations across its entire API documentation.

**Your Question**:
> "Can you read an entire documentation site at once?"

**How to Ask Gemini**:

```bash
gemini --web-fetch "https://docs.fastapi.tiangolo.com/" "Across the entire FastAPI documentation, what are all the ways I can implement concurrency? Compare native async/await, background tasks, and third-party async patterns."
```

**What Gemini Tells You**:
- Yes, it can read hundreds of documentation pages
- It synthesizes patterns across the entire documentation
- You get a comprehensive comparison you'd never find in a single manual read

**Compare to Claude Code**: You'd need to read docs manually or paste sections piece-by-piece.

---

### Scenario 3: Multi-File Refactoring

**Situation**: You're refactoring authentication logic that touches 15+ files across your codebase. You need a comprehensive plan that keeps everything consistent.

**Your Question**:
> "I'm refactoring JWT to OAuth2. I need to change 15 files consistently. Can you see them all at once?"

**How to Ask Gemini**:

```bash
gemini --file ./src/**/*.py "I'm refactoring from JWT to OAuth2. Show me every file that needs changes and create a step-by-step refactoring plan that maintains consistency across all 15 files."
```

**What Gemini Tells You**:
- Yes, it sees all 15 files simultaneously
- It identifies all dependencies (imports, function calls, configuration)
- It provides a comprehensive plan that avoids inconsistencies

**Compare to Claude Code**: You'd refactor file-by-file, risk missing dependencies, and need manual cross-checking.

---

## The Real Decision Framework: Ask AI About Your Situation

Here's the truth: **You don't need to memorize when context matters.** Instead, learn to ask.

### The Meta-Skill: Consulting AI About Tool Choices

When you're uncertain whether Gemini CLI or Claude Code is right for your task, ask:

**Step 1: Describe Your Situation**
```
I have a 75-file project with about 18,000 lines of Python code. I need to refactor
the database layer, which touches 20+ files. Should I use Gemini CLI or Claude Code
for this task?
```

**Step 2: Let AI Guide Your Decision**
Gemini might respond:
- "18,000 lines fits easily in both tools"
- "However, since you're refactoring across 20+ files, Gemini CLI's larger context window means you see all dependencies at once"
- "With Claude Code, you'd need multiple conversations to handle all 20 files"
- "Recommendation: Use Gemini CLI for this refactoring to get a comprehensive plan in one conversation"

**Step 3: Trust the Dialogue**
You now have a specific recommendation based on your exact situation, not a generic checklist.

---

## Practice: Ask Gemini About Your Real Project

**Exercise 1: Assess Your Current Project**

Think of a real project you're working on (or one you've worked on recently).

**Open Gemini CLI and ask:**
```bash
gemini "I'm working on a [PROJECT TYPE] with [NUMBER] files and approximately [LINES OF CODE] lines.
I need to [YOUR SPECIFIC TASK].
Should I use Gemini CLI or Claude Code for this? Why?"
```

**Example:**
```bash
gemini "I'm working on a Django web app with 45 files and approximately 12,000 lines.
I need to refactor the authentication system to use OAuth2.
Should I use Gemini CLI or Claude Code for this? Why?"
```

**What to observe**:
- Does Gemini recommend itself or another tool?
- What reasoning does it give?
- Do you understand the trade-offs?

**Write down the response.** This is your personalized tool selection framework.

---

**Exercise 2: Ask About Edge Cases**

Sometimes you're not sure about project size. Ask AI to help you estimate:

```bash
gemini "How do I estimate the number of tokens in my codebase?
I have a Node.js project with 8 JavaScript files.
Will it fit in a 200K token context window?"
```

**What you'll learn**:
- Gemini gives you a quick estimation method
- You understand whether your project is large, medium, or small
- You get a recommendation for which tool to use

---

**Exercise 3: Compare Tools for Your Specific Constraint**

If budget is a factor:

```bash
gemini "I have limited budget for API calls. I'm working on a 50-file Python project.
Should I use Gemini CLI's free tier or pay for Claude Code API?
What are the trade-offs?"
```

**What you'll learn**:
- Whether your project size fits free tier limits
- Cost-benefit analysis for your situation
- A decision based on your constraints, not generic advice

---

## Understanding Tool Trade-Offs (Without Memorizing)

You don't need to memorize tool comparisons. But you should understand the dimensions of difference. Here's a quick reference:

### Key Dimensions (Ask Gemini About These)

**Context Window**
- Ask: "Does my 50-file project fit in your context window?"
- Gemini answers based on YOUR project

**Cost**
- Ask: "What's the total cost to analyze my codebase with Gemini CLI vs Claude Code?"
- Gemini calculates based on YOUR usage

**Interface**
- Ask: "Do you work in the terminal or web browser?"
- You already know your preference; Gemini confirms compatibility

**Customization**
- Ask: "Can I customize Gemini CLI for my specific needs?"
- Gemini explains available options for YOUR use case

**Enterprise Compliance**
- Ask: "Does Gemini CLI meet SOC 2 compliance requirements?"
- Gemini gives you the answer directly

---

## Real Dialogue Example: How This Works in Practice

Let's see what an actual conversation looks like:

**You**: "I'm working on a monorepo with 200 JavaScript files across 5 services. I want to understand how authentication flows across all services. Which tool should I use?"

**Gemini**: "Great question. Let me help you evaluate:

- **File count**: 200 files is substantial—your context window is critical
- **Gemini CLI can see**: All 200 files in one analysis (~150K-200K tokens)
- **Claude Code would need**: Multiple separate conversations (each limited to ~50-100 files)
- **Your benefit with Gemini CLI**: Complete architectural analysis of how auth flows across all 5 services
- **Recommendation**: Gemini CLI. The larger context lets you see cross-service patterns in one prompt instead of 5 separate conversations."

**You**: "That makes sense. But what if I wanted to use Claude Code anyway?"

**Gemini**: "You could, but you'd need to:
1. Analyze each service separately (5 conversations)
2. Manually cross-reference auth patterns
3. Create your own architectural diagram

It's doable, just more work. Gemini CLI is more efficient for this specific scenario."

**You**: "Okay, I'll use Gemini CLI. How do I start?"

**Gemini**: "Here's your command:
```bash
gemini --file ./services/**/*.js "Map the complete authentication flow across all 5 services. Show how credentials are passed, validated, and used in each service."
```"

## Key Insight: Context Matters, But Asking Matters More

By now, you've learned:

1. **Context windows exist**, and they differ between tools
2. **Most tasks don't require large context**—either tool works fine
3. **Specific scenarios benefit from larger context**—large codebases, documentation synthesis, multi-file refactoring
4. **You don't memorize decision criteria**—you ask AI about YOUR situation
5. **Gemini can evaluate itself**—ask whether it's the right tool for your task

The meta-skill is this: **Learn to ask your AI tools to evaluate themselves.**

This approach scales to future tools too. When Claude's context grows, or when new tools emerge, you'll already know how to consult AI about which tool fits your needs.

---

## Connecting to What's Next

You now understand context windows and how to make tool decisions through dialogue with AI. In Lesson 5, you'll explore the Gemini CLI ecosystem—extensions, integrations, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that makes Gemini adaptable to any environment.

But before you move forward, make sure you've completed the practice exercises above. Tool selection becomes intuitive once you've asked Gemini about your own real projects.

## Try With AI: Personalized Tool Selection for Your Project

### Setup
Open **Gemini CLI** (your AI companion from previous lessons). You'll now use Gemini to evaluate itself as the right tool for your specific situation.

### Prompt Set (Work through these in order)

**Prompt 1: Assess Your Project**
```
I'm working on a [PROJECT TYPE] project with approximately [NUMBER] files and
[ROUGH LINE COUNT] lines of code. Here's what I'm trying to do: [YOUR SPECIFIC TASK].

Can I analyze my entire codebase at once with your context window, or do I need
to break it into smaller pieces?
```

*Example:*
```
I'm working on a Django REST API with 35 files and roughly 8,500 lines of Python.
I want to analyze the entire user authentication system for security vulnerabilities.

Can I analyze my entire codebase at once with your context window, or do I need
to break it into smaller pieces?
```

**Expected Outcome**: Gemini tells you whether your project fits in its context window and whether you can analyze it in one conversation or multiple.

---

**Prompt 2: Compare to Claude Code**
```
Based on the project size you just evaluated, is Gemini CLI or Claude Code a better
choice for my [SPECIFIC TASK]? Explain the trade-offs.
```

*Example:*
```
Based on the 8,500-line Django project I just described, is Gemini CLI or Claude Code
a better choice for analyzing my authentication system? Explain the trade-offs.
```

**Expected Outcome**: Gemini recommends one tool over the other with specific reasoning tied to your project size and task type.

---

**Prompt 3: Ask About Your Constraint**
```
My main constraint is [BUDGET/INTERFACE/COMPLIANCE/OTHER]. Given this constraint,
which tool should I choose for [YOUR TASK]?
```

*Example:*
```
My main constraint is budget—I'm using the free tier. Given this constraint, which
tool should I choose for refactoring my authentication system?
```

**Expected Outcome**: Gemini evaluates the tool choice through the lens of your specific constraint, showing whether free tier limits are sufficient for your task.

---

**Prompt 4 (Optional Stretch): Plan Your Analysis**
```
Based on our conversation, create a step-by-step plan for me to analyze my entire
[PROJECT AREA] using Gemini CLI. What files should I include? What questions should I ask?
```

*Example:*
```
Based on our conversation, create a step-by-step plan for me to analyze my entire
authentication system using Gemini CLI. What files should I include? What questions
should I ask?
```

**Expected Outcome**: A concrete, copyable plan for your analysis—filenames, command structure, and question sequence.

---

### Safety & Ethics Note

When evaluating tools, remember: **All AI tools have trade-offs.**
- Gemini CLI is powerful but requires terminal familiarity
- Claude Code has excellent documentation but smaller context windows
- No tool is perfect for every situation

Use this guidance to make informed decisions, but remain skeptical of any claims that one tool solves all problems. Real-world development requires combining multiple tools and approaches.

### Next Self-Directed Variation

After completing the prompts above, try this variation on your next project:

**Before starting a new task, always ask**: "Is Gemini CLI or [another tool] better for this? Why?"

Make this a habit. Over time, you'll develop intuition about which tool fits which scenario—and you'll know how to ask when you're uncertain.
