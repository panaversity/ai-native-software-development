# Creating and Using Agent Skills

## The Competitive Advantage Hiding in Plain Sight

Skills are your team's reusable intelligence. Claude Code can autoâ€‘detect opportunities to apply that intelligence and can also autoâ€‘delegate to the right subagent when focused execution is needed.

Imagine you're working on a Python project. You've created a `docstring-writer` subagent to add documentation to functions. But in the flow of development, you forget to invoke it. You write five new functions, commit them, and move on. A week later during code review, you realize: no docstrings.

**What if Claude Code could automatically suggest adding docstrings when you write a new functionâ€”without you asking?**

**What if your company's domain expertise could be encoded once and then autonomously applied across every project, every developer, every day?**

That's the power of **Agent Skills**. Skills are **discovered and suggested autonomously by Claude Code** when relevant, then executed with your approval. Subagents handle focused, isolated execution; skills continuously inject shared standards and domain expertise.

In this lesson, you'll learn how skills work, create your first skill (a Python docstring generator), and understand why building a skill library is a strategic competitive advantage for teams and companies.

## What Are Agent Skills?

**Definition**: An Agent Skill is a modular, discoverable capability that Claude Code can autonomously invoke when working on relevant tasks. Skills are defined by a `SKILL.md` file containing instructions and a **description** that helps Claude decide when to use them.

### Skills vs. Subagents vs. Slash Commands

You've now seen three ways to extend Claude Code. Here's how they differ:

| Feature | Subagent | Agent Skill | Slash Command |
|---------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Invocation** | Explicit or autoâ€‘delegated | **Autonomous**: Claude discovers and suggests | Explicit: `/command-name` |
| **Discovery** | Manualâ€”you decide when to run | **Automatic**â€”Claude decides based on context | Manualâ€”you type the command |
| **Use Case** | Repetitive focused tasks | Domain expertise applied automatically | Predefined workflows |
| **Example** | `claude agent run code-reviewer` | Claude detects Python file, suggests docstrings | `/commit` to create git commit |
| **Competitive Advantage** | Medium (consistency) | **High (scales expertise)** | Low (simple automation) |

**Working together**
- Subagents: isolated context, task ownership (Claude may autoâ€‘delegate)
- Skills: ambient capabilities that refine outputs across phases
> Claude discovers skills from `SKILL.md` descriptions and can delegate to subagents when your task clearly matches their description. See Subagents docs for details.

## A Day in the Flow: Zero Extra Prompts

Morning:
- You open a PR to add a new endpoint. Claude suggests security and typeâ€‘hint skills. You accept; they run with no extra prompting.
- Claude autoâ€‘delegates to your `test-runner` subagent to run tests in isolated context; failures are summarized back in the main thread.

Afternoon:
- While refactoring, skills suggest docstrings and complexity checks; you accept inline.
- For a performance report, Claude delegates to a `profiler` subagent; skills annotate the findings (clarity, pedagogy, compliance) before summarizing.

Outcome: predictable execution in clean contexts (subagents) + continuously applied standards and domain expertise (skills) without added cognitive load.

## Why Agent Skills Matter: The Strategic Value

Agent Skills aren't just a technical featureâ€”they're a **strategic business advantage**. Here's why:

### 1. Expertise That Scales Automatically

**Without Skills**:
- Senior developer explains best practices to junior developer
- Junior developer forgets 60% within a week
- Process repeats for every new hire
- Knowledge stays locked in people's heads

**With Skills**:
- Senior developer encodes expertise once as a skill
- Claude Code applies it automatically across all projects
- Every developer benefits immediately
- Knowledge captured permanently in version control

**Example**: A security expert creates an `sql-injection-checker` skill. Now every developerâ€”regardless of security expertiseâ€”gets automatic alerts when writing database queries that might be vulnerable.

### 2. Consistent Standards Without Enforcement Overhead

**Without Skills**:
- Team agrees on coding standards (docstrings, type hints, naming conventions)
- Code reviews catch violations manually
- Inconsistency creeps in over time
- Engineers spend hours enforcing standards

**With Skills**:
- Standards encoded as skills (e.g., `enforce-type-hints`, `docstring-generator`)
- Claude Code automatically applies them
- Standards maintained consistently without manual enforcement
- Engineers focus on logic, not style policing

### 3. Competitive Differentiation Through Domain Expertise

This is where skills become truly powerful: **Your unique domain knowledge becomes an automated advantage.**

**Example 1**: A fintech company builds a `compliance-checker` skill that validates financial calculations against regulatory requirements. Their developers ship compliant code faster than competitors who review regulations manually.

**Example 2**: A healthcare startup creates a `hipaa-privacy-auditor` skill that scans code for potential PHI (Protected Health Information) leaks. Their code is secure by default; competitors discover privacy issues in production.

**Example 3**: A machine learning team builds a `model-reproducibility-checker` skill that ensures experiments log hyperparameters and random seeds. Their models are reproducible; competitors waste weeks debugging non-deterministic results.

**The pattern**: Domain expertise encoded as skills compounds over time, creating organizational capabilities that competitors can't easily replicate.

## How Agent Skills Work: The Discovery Mechanism

Let's understand the magic behind autonomous discovery.

### Skill Anatomy: The SKILL.md File

Every skill is defined by a `SKILL.md` file with three critical sections:

**1. Discoverable Description** (most important):
- Clear trigger: when should Claude suggest this skill?
- Outcome: what does the skill produce?
- Scope and boundaries: what it will and will not do

**2. Skill Instructions**:
- Checklist of steps to follow
- Quality bar: what good output looks like
- Edge cases and constraints to respect

**3. Examples** (optional):
- Brief before/after descriptions (no code required)

### Discovery Process

Here's how Claude Code decides to use a skill:

1. Context analysis: current task, open artifacts, recent conversation
2. Skill scanning: available skillsâ€™ discoverable descriptions
3. Relevance matching: which skills match the context
4. Suggestion: propose applying relevant skills
5. Approval: accept or skip
6. Execution: follow the skillâ€™s instructions and report back

**Key Insight**: The **description** is what makes skills discoverable. A vague description means Claude won't know when to use the skill. A specific, context-rich description enables autonomous discovery.

## Skill Scopes: Where Skills Live

Skills can exist at three levels:

**1. Personal Skills** (`~/.claude/skills/`)
- Your personal toolkit
- Not shared with projects or team
- Use for personal workflow preferences

**2. Project Skills** (`.claude/skills/` in project directory)
- Specific to one project
- Committed to version control
- Team members inherit when they clone the repo
- **Most common for team collaboration**

**3. Plugin Skills** (installed from skill registry)
- Publicly available skills
- Installed with `claude skill install <name>`
- Maintained by community or vendors

**Best Practice**: Use **project skills** for team standards and domain expertise. This ensures everyone on the team benefits from shared knowledge.

## Quick Start: Add One Skill, See It Work

Goal: add a project skill that explains runtime errors.

Ask Claude:
```
Create a project skill named "error-explainer" that, when a Python error occurs, identifies the error type, explains the cause in simple terms, and proposes a minimal fix. Store it in .claude/skills/.
```

Then trigger an error in your code as usual. Claude will suggest the skill when relevant and summarize the fixâ€”no extra prompting.

---

## âœ“ Your Skill Is Working When:

**Quick check**:

1. **Skill is created** - Skill directory exists
2. **Skill is discovered** - When relevant, Claude suggests using it
3. **Explanations are helpful** - You understand what went wrong and how to fix it
4. **It saves you time** - You don't have to google the errorâ€”Claude explains it immediately

**If this works**: ðŸŽ‰ **Your collaborative skill is ready! Claude now automatically helps you understand errors as you encounter them.**

---

## How Skills Work

Skills are **collaborative helpers that Claude discovers automatically**. Unlike subagents (which you explicitly invoke), skills work in the background.

When Claude notices you need help (errors, missing docs, missing types, security checks), it suggests your skill.

**Key point**: Skills should complement your development workflow, not add complexity. Start simple.

## What's Next: Lesson 5 - MCP and Workflows

You've learned how to extend Claude Code internally with subagents and skills. But what if you need Claude Code to access **external systems**?

That's where **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** comes in. MCP allows Claude Code to connect to external data sources and tools, dramatically expanding its capabilities.

In Lesson 5, you'll:
- Learn what MCP is and how it works
- Connect Claude Code to a GitHub MCP server
- See complete workflows combining files, commands, and external integrations
- **Understand security considerations** for evaluating third-party MCP servers
- Explore four common real-world workflows

**The final piece**: Combining everything you've learnedâ€”installation, subagents, skills, and MCPâ€”into powerful, integrated development workflows.

Let's complete your Claude Code mastery.
