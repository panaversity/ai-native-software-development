# Understanding and Using Subagents

## The Problem: Context Pollution and Specialization

You've installed Claude Code and run your first commands. But as you use it more, you'll encounter a common challenge: **context pollution**.

Imagine this scenario: You're working on a Python project. You ask Claude Code to help debug a function, then to review your code for style issues, then to generate documentation, then to suggest performance optimizations. By the time you're on your fifth request, Claude Code's context includes all your previous conversations‚Äîdebugging details, style discussions, documentation drafts. The conversation has become cluttered.

**What if you could press "reset" without losing your work?**

**What if you could have specialized AI assistants for different tasks‚Äîa code reviewer, a documentation writer, a debugging expert‚Äîeach with clear focus and isolated context?**

That's what **subagents** enable. They're one of Claude Code's most powerful features, yet often overlooked by beginners who stick to the main conversation for everything.

In this lesson, you'll learn what subagents are, when to use them, and how to create your first custom subagent‚Äîa code reviewer that applies your team's specific standards.

## What Are Subagents?

**Definition**: A subagent is a specialized task-specific agent for improved context management. They are configured with custom instructions (called a "system prompt") and isolated context separate from the main conversation.

Think of subagents as specialized team members:

- **Main Claude Code**: Your general assistant‚Äîhandles one-off questions, exploratory tasks, varied workflows. It will manage the subagents as well.
- **Subagent 1 (Code Reviewer)**: Focused solely on reviewing code for bugs, style, and best practices
- **Subagent 2 (Test Writer)**: Specialized in generating unit tests for functions
- **Subagent 3 (Documentation Generator)**: Expert at writing clear, comprehensive documentation

Each subagent has:
1. **Custom system prompt**: Instructions that define its role, constraints, and expertise
2. **Isolated context**: Conversations in this subagent don't affect the main conversation or other subagents
3. **Tool access configuration**: You can limit which tools (file read/write, command execution) the subagent can use

### Subagents vs. Main Conversation: When to Use Each

| Aspect | Main Conversation | Subagent |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| **Use Case** | Exploratory work, varied tasks, one-off questions | Repetitive specialized tasks with clear scope |
| **Context** | Accumulates all conversation history | Isolated‚Äîonly sees subagent's own history |
| **Customization** | General-purpose Claude behavior | Custom system prompt defines specific role |
| **When to Use** | "Help me understand this error" | "Review this code using our team's style guide" |
| **Examples** | Debugging, learning concepts, exploring codebases | Code reviews, test generation, refactoring, documentation |

**Key Insight**: Use subagents when you have **repeatable tasks with clear instructions**. Use the main conversation when you need flexibility and exploration.

## Why Subagents Matter: Three Key Benefits

### Benefit 1: Context Preservation

**Problem Without Subagents**: After 10 interactions in the main conversation, Claude Code's context is filled with unrelated discussions. Asking for a code review now means Claude considers all previous context‚Äîeven if irrelevant.

**Solution With Subagents**: Launch a fresh subagent for each focused task. The code review happens in a clean context, without clutter from previous debugging or documentation work.

### Benefit 2: Specialization and Consistency

**Problem Without Subagents**: You must repeatedly tell Claude Code your code review standards, testing framework preferences, or documentation style with every new session.

**Solution With Subagents**: Encode these instructions once in a subagent's system prompt. Every time you invoke the "code-reviewer" subagent, it already knows your standards.

**Example System Prompt for Code Reviewer**:
```
You are a code reviewer specializing in Python.
Apply these standards:
- PEP 8 style compliance
- Type hints required for all functions
- Docstrings required (Google style)
- Prefer list comprehensions over loops where readable
- Flag any security concerns (SQL injection, hardcoded secrets)
- Suggest performance improvements for O(n¬≤) or worse complexity
```

Every code review from this subagent applies these standards consistently.

### Benefit 3: Reusability Across Projects

**Problem Without Subagents**: You manually recreate your preferred workflows for each new project.

**Solution With Subagents**: Subagents are stored as files in `.claude/agents/`. You can:
- Share subagents with your team via version control
- Reuse the same subagent across multiple projects
- Build a library of specialized assistants

A well-designed subagent becomes **organizational knowledge**‚Äîcapturing expertise that benefits your entire team.

## Subagent Architecture: How They Work

Let's peek under the hood to understand how subagents function.

### File Structure

When you create a subagent named `code-reviewer`, Claude stores a single file under `.claude/agents/` with:
- A name and short description of its purpose
- Optional model selection and color
- A clear checklist of standards it applies
- The expected form of its output (e.g., prioritized issues and actionable suggestions)

### Subagent Lifecycle (Zero Overhead View)

1. Create once via `/agents` and describe the role.
2. Use naturally ("Use the code-reviewer subagent...")‚ÄîClaude may also auto‚Äëdelegate when the match is obvious.
3. Work happens in a clean, isolated context; results return to the main thread.
4. Iterate the description over time as your team practices evolve.

## Creating a "Latest News" Subagent

Let's create a **"latest-news" subagent**‚Äîa focused researcher that surfaces current headlines, trends, and concise summaries with citations.

### Step 1: Create the Subagent

- Open the `/agents` interface and select "Create new agent"
- Choose Project location so your team can reuse it
- Describe the role succinctly, for example:
  - Purpose: daily news researcher for a chosen domain (e.g., AI, security)
  - Output: 5‚Äì7 bulleted headlines with one‚Äësentence summaries and links; a short trend synopsis; 2 follow‚Äëup questions
  - Constraints: prioritize reputable sources; avoid duplicates; keep total read under 2 minutes

Claude will create the subagent file under `.claude/agents/latest-news.md` (or similar) with your description and settings.

**Expected result**: The agent appears in your list and retains its focused role.

### Step 2: Try the "Latest News" Subagent (Daily Workflow)

- Try now: Ask Claude to use the latest-news subagent for your topic today (for example, AI policy). You should receive headlines with links, a short trend synopsis, and two follow‚Äëup questions.

**If you see targeted, phase‚Äëspecific feedback**: ‚úÖ It works. You get clean execution and clear results with minimal prompting.

## Delegation Modes

Subagents can be used in two ways:

- Explicit invocation: You request a specific subagent (e.g., "Use the code-reviewer subagent to check my recent changes").
- Automatic delegation: Claude can delegate to a subagent when your task clearly matches that subagent‚Äôs description and allowed tools.

Use explicit invocation for predictability. Rely on automatic delegation as a convenience when descriptions are specific. 

---

## ‚úì Your Subagent Is Working When:

**Quick verification**:

1. **Subagent is created** - You can list it
2. **Subagent can be invoked** - You can ask it to explain code
3. **It returns helpful explanations** - The response makes sense and helps clarify the code
4. **It stays in character** - Multiple invocations maintain the "collaborative explainer" role

**If this works**: üéâ **Your collaborative helper is ready! You now have a dedicated partner to help you understand code.**

## When to Use Subagents: Practical Scenarios

Here are five common scenarios where subagents provide value:

### Scenario 1: Code Reviews

**Setup**: Create a `code-reviewer` subagent with your team's style guide
**Invocation**: `claude agent run code-reviewer "Review src/utils.py"`
**Benefit**: Consistent reviews applying team standards every time

### Scenario 2: Test Generation

**Setup**: Create a `test-writer` subagent specialized in your testing framework (pytest, unittest, etc.)
**Invocation**: `claude agent run test-writer "Generate tests for src/auth.py"`
**Benefit**: Tests follow project conventions without explaining them each time

### Scenario 3: Documentation Writing

**Setup**: Create a `doc-writer` subagent that generates API documentation in your preferred format
**Invocation**: `claude agent run doc-writer "Document all functions in api/routes.py"`
**Benefit**: Consistent documentation style across the codebase

### Scenario 4: Refactoring Assistant

**Setup**: Create a `refactor-helper` subagent focused on code simplification and pattern recognition
**Invocation**: `claude agent run refactor-helper "Suggest refactorings for src/legacy.py"`
**Benefit**: Non-destructive suggestions without changing unrelated code

### Scenario 5: Security Auditor

**Setup**: Create a `security-auditor` subagent that scans for common vulnerabilities
**Invocation**: `claude agent run security-auditor "Check src/ for security issues"`
**Benefit**: Systematic security checks using OWASP or CWE standards

## Subagent Best Practices

**1. Keep System Prompts Focused**
- One clear responsibility per subagent
- Avoid combining unrelated tasks (e.g., "review code AND generate docs")

**2. Use Descriptive Names**
- ‚úÖ `python-code-reviewer`, `pytest-test-generator`
- ‚ùå `helper`, `tool1`, `bob`

**3. Limit Tool Access Appropriately**
- Read-only subagents for analysis tasks
- Full access only when necessary (e.g., refactoring subagents)

**4. Iterate and Improve**
- After using a subagent, refine its system prompt
- Add examples of good/bad outputs to guide behavior
- Collect feedback from team members

## Pause and Reflect: Specialization vs. Flexibility

You've learned how to create specialized AI assistants with subagents. But there's a tradeoff to consider:

**Specialization** provides consistency and focus, but reduces flexibility. A code-reviewer subagent won't help you debug runtime errors or generate documentation‚Äîthat's by design.

**The main conversation** is flexible and exploratory, but lacks the focused instructions and clean context that subagents provide.

**Reflection Questions**:
- Think about your own daily workflow. What repetitive tasks could benefit from a specialized subagent?
- When would you prefer the flexibility of the main conversation over a focused subagent?
- If you work on a team, what subagents could capture and share your team's unique expertise?

## Try With AI

Use Claude Code for this activity. If you already have another AI companion tool set up (e.g., ChatGPT web, Gemini CLI), you may use that instead‚Äîthe prompts are the same.

**Prompts:**

1) "I'm confused about when to use subagents vs. the main conversation. Give me a simple decision tree: For each scenario below, should I use a subagent or main conversation? (a) Quick question about Python syntax, (b) Code review following team standards, (c) Debugging a weird error I've never seen, (d) Generating tests for 10 similar functions, (e) Exploring a new codebase I just downloaded."

2) "I want to create my FIRST subagent. My most repetitive task is [describe your task: code reviews / writing tests / generating docs / etc.]. Help me design it: (a) What should I name it? (b) What 3-5 instructions should go in the system prompt? (c) What tool access should it have? (d) Give me the exact command to create it."

3) "The lesson shows a code-reviewer subagent with specific standards (PEP 8, type hints, docstrings). I work with [your language/framework]. Create a custom system prompt for a code-reviewer subagent tailored to MY stack. Include 5-7 specific standards I should enforce. Make it copy-paste ready."

4) "I created a subagent but I'm not sure it's working correctly. How do I test it? Give me a safe 'test scenario': (a) what sample code/task to give it, (b) what good output looks like, (c) what bad output looks like, (d) how to iterate and improve the system prompt based on results."

**Expected outcomes:**

- Clear decision framework for when to use subagents
- Complete design for your first custom subagent
- Copy-paste-ready system prompt for your specific needs
- Testing methodology to validate and improve subagents

**Safety/ethics note:**

- Start with read-only subagents (analysis/review) before write access (refactoring/generation)
- Test subagents on non-critical code first
- Review all subagent outputs carefully until you trust their consistency
