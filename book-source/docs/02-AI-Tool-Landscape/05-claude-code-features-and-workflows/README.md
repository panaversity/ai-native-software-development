**Level**: Beginner to Intermediate

## What You'll Learn

This chapter introduces Claude Code—Anthropic's revolutionary command-line AI assistant—through a blend of compelling narrative and hands-on tutorials. You'll understand not just *how* to use Claude Code, but *why* it represents a paradigm shift in AI-assisted development.

By the end of this chapter, you will:

- ✅ **Understand** the paradigm shift from passive AI assistance to agentic collaboration
- ✅ **Install and configure** Claude Code on your system (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- ✅ **Create custom subagents** for specialized development tasks
- ✅ **Build Agent Skills** that Claude Code discovers and invokes autonomously
- ✅ **Connect MCP servers** to give Claude Code access to external data sources

## Chapter Structure

### Lesson 1: The Claude Code Origin Story and Paradigm Shift
**Duration**: 8-10 minutes | **Type**: Narrative
Learn how Claude Code came to be, what makes it different from chat-based AI tools, and why it matters for modern development.

**Key Concepts**: Agentic vs. passive AI, terminal integration, paradigm shift in development

---

### Lesson 2: Installing and Authenticating Claude Code
**Duration**: 27-35 minutes | **Type**: Technical (Hands-on)
Get Claude Code working on your machine with platform-specific installation instructions and comprehensive troubleshooting.

**What You'll Do**:
- Choose between NPM and native installation methods
- Complete authentication (Claude.ai or Claude Console)
- Verify your setup with a working test
- Troubleshoot common installation errors

**Success Target**: 95% install successfully on first attempt

---

### Lesson 3: Understanding and Using Subagents
**Duration**: 25-32 minutes | **Type**: Technical (Tutorial)
Create your first subagent and learn when specialization provides value.

**What You'll Build**:
- A code-reviewer subagent with specialized instructions
- Understanding of when to use subagents vs. main conversation

**Success Target**: 80% can create custom subagent and explain usage

---

### Lesson 4: Creating and Using Agent Skills
**Duration**: 32-39 minutes | **Type**: Technical (Advanced)
Build custom skills that Claude Code discovers autonomously, and understand how skill libraries create competitive advantage.

**What You'll Build**:
- A python-docstring-writer skill with discoverable description
- Understanding of skill discovery mechanisms

**Success Target**: 80% can create skills Claude discovers autonomously

**Key Insight**: Domain-specific skill libraries amplify your team's unique expertise

---

### Lesson 5: Connecting MCP Servers and Common Workflows
**Duration**: 32-39 minutes | **Type**: Technical (Practical)
Integrate external services and demonstrate real-world Claude Code workflows. **Includes prominent security guidance**.

**What You'll Do**:
- Connect GitHub MCP server securely
- Use MCP in practical debugging tasks
- Learn 4 complete workflows (codebase exploration, issue debugging, database validation, multi-system debugging)

**Success Target**: 75% successfully connect and use MCP in task

**⚠️ Security Emphasis**: Learn to evaluate third-party MCP servers safely

## Learning Path

This chapter follows a carefully scaffolded progression:

1. **Foundation** (Lesson 1): Understand the "why" before the "how"
2. **Setup** (Lesson 2): Get the tool working on your system
3. **Specialization** (Lesson 3): Learn to create focused AI assistants (subagents)
4. **Automation** (Lesson 4): Build skills Claude discovers autonomously
5. **Integration** (Lesson 5): Connect to external data sources (MCP)

Each lesson builds on the previous, creating a complete mental model of Claude Code's capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have:

- ✅ **Completed Part 1** (Chapters 1-4): Understanding of AI-driven development concepts
- ✅ **Terminal/command-line familiarity**: Ability to navigate directories, run commands
- ✅ **Claude account**: Either Claude.ai subscription OR Claude Console account with API credits
- ✅ **Development environment**: Node.js 18+ (for NPM installation) OR ability to use native installers
- ✅ **Project to work with**: Any code project (even a simple one) for hands-on practice

## What Makes This Chapter Unique

**Hybrid Format**: Unlike traditional technical tutorials, this chapter combines:
- **Narrative storytelling** (Lesson 1) to establish context and motivation
- **Practical tutorials** (Lessons 2-5) with hands-on exercises and real code

**Emphasis on "Learning WITH AI"**: You won't just learn to *use* Claude Code—you'll learn to *collaborate* with it as an active development partner.

**Real-World Focus**: All tutorials use realistic scenarios and practical workflows you'll apply immediately.

**Security-Conscious**: Lesson 5 includes comprehensive security guidance for evaluating third-party MCP servers.

## Time Investment

**Minimum Path** (Reading only): 30-35 minutes
**Full Engagement** (Reading + all hands-on exercises): 75-95 minutes
**Mastery Path** (Including supplementary practice): 3-4 hours

**Recommended Approach**: Complete Lessons 1-2 in your first session (get Claude Code installed), then tackle Lessons 3-5 as separate focused sessions.

## Success Indicators

You'll know you've mastered this chapter when you can:

1. Explain the paradigm shift from passive to agentic AI assistance
2. Install Claude Code on any platform and troubleshoot common issues
3. Create custom subagents for specialized development tasks
4. Build Agent Skills that Claude Code discovers and invokes autonomously
5. Connect MCP servers securely and use them in practical workflows
6. Articulate when to use Claude Code vs. other AI coding tools

## Chapter Reflection

After completing all 5 lessons, you'll find a comprehensive reflection prompt in Lesson 5 that connects everything you've learned. This reflection helps you:

- Consolidate knowledge across all 5 lessons
- Identify which concepts had the biggest impact on your understanding
- Plan how to apply Claude Code to your specific development work

## What's Next: Chapter 6

After mastering Claude Code's features, you'll dive into **AI-Driven Development (AIDD)**: a comprehensive methodology for building software with AI as a first-class collaborator.

**Preview**: Chapter 6 teaches the systematic process behind effective AI collaboration—not just which tools to use, but *how* to structure problems so AI can help solve them.
