# Putting It All Together: Real-World AI-Assisted Workflows

**Duration**: 35-40 minutes

## Introduction: From Skills to Workflows

You've spent seven lessons building individual Bash skills. Now it's time to **integrate everything** into the kind of workflows you'll encounter in real AI-driven development projects.

This lesson isn't about learning new commands—it's about **orchestrating** what you already know into complete, realistic scenarios. You'll see how professionals set up projects, troubleshoot errors, and migrate files—all with AI assistance but **always with human verification**.

**Key insight:** Real-world workflows are messy. They involve checking existing state, making decisions based on context, handling errors, and validating results. AI can accelerate these tasks, but you remain the **decision-maker and safety validator**.

---

## Workflow 1: Project Setup from Scratch (AI-Assisted)

**Scenario:** You're starting a new Python project. You need to create directories, initialize Git, set up environment variables, and create initial files. You'll use AI to generate the commands, but verify each step.

### Step 1: Plan the Structure (Ask AI)

**Prompt to AI:**
```
I'm starting a Python project called 'data-pipeline'. I need:
- A main directory with subdirectories: src/, tests/, docs/, config/
- A virtual environment in venv/
- Git initialization
- A .env file for API keys (not committed to Git)
- A basic README.md

Give me the Bash commands to set this up.
```

### Step 2: Verify Before Execution

**Before running ANY commands**, check:

1. **Does the directory already exist?** → Run `ls` to confirm
2. **Do you understand each command?** → If not, ask AI to explain
3. **Are there destructive operations?** → Check for `rm`, `>` (overwrite), or `sudo`
4. **Will this conflict with existing files?** → Verify the location first

### Step 3: Execute and Validate

Run the commands **one at a time**:

```bash
# Create and enter directory
mkdir data-pipeline && cd data-pipeline
ls -la  # Validate

# Create subdirectories
mkdir src tests docs config
ls  # Validate

# Git and Python setup
git init
python -m venv venv
ls -la  # Validate

# .gitignore and .env
echo "venv/" >> .gitignore
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
touch .env
cat .gitignore  # Validate

# README
echo "# Data Pipeline Project" > README.md
cat README.md  # Validate
```

### Step 4: Add API Key to .env (Manually)

**Do NOT ask AI to generate API keys or paste them into chat.**

Use nano to add keys:

```bash
nano .env
# Add: API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
```

### Workflow 1 Checklist

- [x] Project directory created with correct structure
- [x] Git initialized
- [x] Virtual environment created
- [x] .gitignore configured to exclude secrets
- [x] .env file created and populated (manually)
- [x] README.md created
- [x] All steps verified incrementally

---

## Workflow 2: Troubleshooting with AI Assistance

**Scenario:** You run a Python script and get an error. You need to diagnose the issue using AI.

### Step 1: Reproduce the Error

```bash
python src/process_data.py
```

**Error output:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'
```

### Step 2: Describe the Error to AI

**Prompt to AI:**
```
I'm running a Python script and getting this error:
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'

I have a virtual environment in venv/. What Bash commands should I run to fix this?
```

### Step 3: Execute and Validate

```bash
# Check if venv is active
echo $VIRTUAL_ENV
# If empty, activate:
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux

# Install pandas
pip install pandas

# Verify
pip show pandas

# Re-run script
python src/process_data.py
```

### Step 4: Document the Fix

```bash
# Create requirements.txt
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Verify
cat requirements.txt

# Commit
git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Add pandas dependency"
```

---

## Workflow 3: File Migration with AI (Copy, Move, Verify)

**Scenario:** Reorganize a project by moving `.py` files from `scripts/` to `src/`, renaming them with a consistent prefix.

### Step 1: Assess Current State

```bash
ls scripts/
# Output: data_loader.py  data_processor.py  data_validator.py
```

### Step 2: Plan the Migration (Ask AI)

**Prompt to AI:**
```
I have three Python files in scripts/:
- data_loader.py
- data_processor.py
- data_validator.py

I want to move them to src/ and rename them with a 'pipeline_' prefix.
Give me the Bash commands to do this safely (copy first, verify, then delete originals).
```

### Step 3: Execute with Checkpoints

```bash
# Copy files
cp scripts/data_loader.py src/pipeline_loader.py
cp scripts/data_processor.py src/pipeline_processor.py
cp scripts/data_validator.py src/pipeline_validator.py

# Verify copies exist
ls src/

# Verify content is identical
diff scripts/data_loader.py src/pipeline_loader.py

# Delete originals (ONLY after verification)
rm scripts/data_loader.py scripts/data_processor.py scripts/data_validator.py

# Final verification
ls scripts/
ls src/
```

## Decision Matrix: When to Memorize vs. Ask AI

| **Factor** | **Memorize Command** | **Ask AI** |
|------------|----------------------|------------|
| **Frequency** | Daily use (`cd`, `ls`, `git status`) | Rare or one-time tasks |
| **Complexity** | Simple, single-purpose (`pwd`, `mkdir`) | Multi-step, conditional, or unfamiliar |
| **Safety Risk** | Low risk (`cat`, `echo`) | High risk (`rm -rf`, `chmod 777`) — **always verify** |
| **Learning Goal** | Core skills you'll use repeatedly | Exploratory tasks or learning new tools |

### Guideline

- **If you'll do it more than 5 times:** Learn and memorize the command
- **If it's complex or high-risk:** Ask AI, but **always verify** before execution
- **If it's exploratory:** Ask AI to learn new patterns, then decide if it's worth memorizing

## Safety Patterns for AI-Generated Commands

### 1. Read Every Command Before Running

**Never blindly copy-paste AI output.**

**Check for:**
- Destructive operations: `rm`, `dd`, `>` (overwrite), `chmod 777`
- Recursive flags: `rm -rf`, `chmod -R`
- Sudo/admin commands: `sudo`, `su`

**Red flags:**
```bash
# ❌ NEVER run without understanding
sudo rm -rf /
curl http://example.com/script.sh | bash
chmod 777 -R /
```

### 2. Test in a Safe Environment First

Create a sandbox:
```bash
mkdir test-sandbox
cd test-sandbox
# Test AI commands here first
```

### 3. Verify File Paths Are Correct

AI may assume a directory structure that doesn't match yours. Always check with `ls` and `pwd`.

### 4. Check for Secrets Leakage

**Never** let AI generate commands that expose secrets.

**Bad:**
```bash
# ❌ Hardcoded API key
export API_KEY=sk-1234567890abcdef
```

**Good:**
```bash
# ✅ Use .env (never commit)
echo "API_KEY=sk-1234567890abcdef" >> .env
```

### Safety Checklist

Before running any AI-generated command:

- [ ] I understand what each part does
- [ ] I verified file paths and directory structure
- [ ] I checked for destructive operations
- [ ] I tested in a sandbox or non-critical directory
- [ ] I confirmed the command is safe for my OS
- [ ] I ensured no secrets are exposed
- [ ] I have a backup or can undo changes

**Objective:** Create a complete Python project structure using AI-generated commands.

**Requirements:**
1. Create project directory `ml-experiment` with subdirectories: `data/`, `models/`, `notebooks/`, `scripts/`
2. Initialize Git and create `.gitignore` to exclude `data/` and `*.pyc`
3. Create Python virtual environment in `venv/`
4. Create `requirements.txt` with: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`
5. Create README.md with project description
6. Verify each step incrementally

---

### Exercise 2: Troubleshoot a Broken Workflow

**Scenario:** You cloned a repository, but `python app.py` fails with multiple errors. Use AI to diagnose and fix.

**Tasks:**
1. Run script and capture error
2. Ask AI for diagnosis
3. Execute fix step-by-step
4. Verify script runs successfully
5. Document troubleshooting process

---

### Exercise 3: Migrate and Reorganize Files Safely

**Objective:** Move files from one directory to another using AI-generated commands, with verification at each step.

**Tasks:**
1. Ask AI for migration commands
2. Execute copy commands
3. Verify copies with `diff`
4. Delete originals only after verification
5. Document migration process

## Reflection: From Bash to Git

You've now completed **all eight lessons** of Bash Essentials. You can:
- Navigate directories and manage files
- Understand and modify permissions
- Work with environment variables and secrets
- Chain commands with pipes and redirects
- Execute realistic workflows with AI assistance
- Verify AI-generated commands for safety

**What's next?** In **Chapter 8: Git & GitHub**, you'll apply these Bash skills to version control:
- Initializing repositories (`git init`)
- Tracking changes (`git add`, `git commit`)
- Working with branches
- Collaborating on GitHub
- Using AI to generate commit messages and resolve merge conflicts

## Summary

This lesson integrated all Bash skills into three realistic workflows:

1. **Project Setup:** Used AI to generate setup commands, verified incrementally, and secured secrets
2. **Troubleshooting:** Diagnosed errors with AI, validated fixes, and documented the process
3. **File Migration:** Safely reorganized files using copy-verify-delete pattern

You also built frameworks for:
- **Deciding when to memorize vs. ask AI** (frequency, complexity, risk)
- **Validating AI-generated commands** (understand, test, verify paths, check for secrets)

**Key Takeaway:** AI accelerates workflows, but **you remain the decision-maker**. Always verify, always understand, always prioritize safety.

You're now ready to apply these skills to Git and GitHub in Chapter 8! 🚀
