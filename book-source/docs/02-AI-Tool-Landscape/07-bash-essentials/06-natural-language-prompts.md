# Natural Language Prompts for Bash Tasks

**Duration**: 35-40 minutes

## Introduction: Paradigm Shift

You've learned Bash commands. Now learn to use AI as a learning partner—not a code generator, but a mentor who helps you understand commands and build confidence.

**The AI-Augmented Workflow:**
1. Describe task in natural language
2. AI generates command
3. **You verify and understand** (never blindly execute)
4. Execute command
5. Iterate if needed

## Part 1: Prompting Patterns

### Pattern 1: Clear Request

```
"Show me my current directory path"
→ pwd

"List all files including hidden ones"
→ ls -la
```

### Pattern 2: Problem Description

```
"I need to find all Python files in my project"
→ find . -name "*.py"

"Count how many errors are in my log file"
→ grep -c "ERROR" server.log
```

### Pattern 3: With Constraints

```
"Copy all .txt files to backup/, but only if modified today"
→ find . -name "*.txt" -mtime -1 -exec cp {} backup/ \;
```

### Pattern 4: Multi-Step

```
"Create a project directory with src, tests, and docs folders, then initialize Git"
→ mkdir my-project && cd my-project && mkdir src tests docs && git init
```

## Part 2: Natural Language → Bash Command Examples

### Navigation

Instead of: `pwd`
```
"Show me my current directory"
"Where am I right now?"
```

Instead of: `cd projects`
```
"Navigate to the projects folder"
"Go into the projects directory"
```

### File Operations

Instead of: `cp file.txt backup/`
```
"Copy file.txt to the backup folder"
"Make a copy of file.txt in backup/"
```

Instead of: `rm temp*.txt`
```
"Delete all files starting with 'temp' and ending with .txt"
```

### Searching

Instead of: `grep "ERROR" log.txt`
```
"Find all lines containing ERROR in log.txt"
"Search for ERROR in the log file"
```

### Environment Variables

Instead of: `export API_KEY="..."`
```
"Set an environment variable called API_KEY"
"Create a temporary variable for my API key"
```

## Part 3: Validation Before Execution

**CRITICAL: Always verify AI-generated commands**

```bash
# AI suggests:
rm -rf /old-project

# Before running, check:
1. Am I in the right directory? (pwd)
2. Does this path exist? (ls /old-project)
3. Do I understand what -rf does? (recursive force delete)
4. Is this safe? (Preview with: ls -R /old-project)
```

**Red flags in AI commands:**
- `rm -rf` (permanent deletion)
- `sudo` (admin privileges)
- `chmod 777` (insecure permissions)
- `curl ... | bash` (executing remote scripts)

---

## Part 4: Iterative Refinement

**Example workflow:**

```
You: "Find Python files modified today"
AI: find . -name "*.py" -mtime 0

You run it → No results

You: "Actually, find Python files modified in the last 24 hours"
AI: find . -name "*.py" -mtime -1

You run it → Works!
```

**Key insight**: AI helps you **learn the right command**, not replace your understanding.

---

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Generate and Verify

Ask AI for commands to:
1. List all files larger than 1MB
2. Count how many directories are in your home folder
3. Find all .log files and delete files older than 7 days

**Before running**: Verify each command, understand what it does.

### Exercise 2: Iterative Refinement

1. Ask AI: "Move all images to a photos folder"
2. Review the command—does it handle multiple image formats?
3. Refine: "Move all .jpg, .png, and .gif files to photos/"
4. Verify and execute

### Exercise 3: Safety Check

AI generates: `rm -rf temp/`

Your checklist:
- [ ] I verified the directory path
- [ ] I listed contents first (`ls -R temp/`)
- [ ] I have backups or this is disposable
- [ ] I understand `-rf` means recursive force delete

## Summary

- Use natural language to describe tasks
- AI generates commands—**you verify before executing**
- Four prompting patterns: clear request, problem, constraints, multi-step
- Always validate: understand command, check paths, identify risks
- Iterate to refine commands until they work correctly

**Key principle**: AI accelerates learning, but **you remain responsible** for understanding and safety.
