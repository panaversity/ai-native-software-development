# Essential Navigation and File Management Commands

**Duration**: 40-45 minutes

## Opening: From Tourist to Navigator

In Lesson 1, you learned to open the terminal and peek at your current location. You're like a tourist who just learned to read street signs. Now it's time to become a confident navigator—someone who can move through the file system, create new spaces, and manage files like a professional developer.

Think about moving into a new apartment. You don't just stand in the doorway forever. You explore rooms, create storage spaces, move furniture, and occasionally throw things away. The terminal commands you'll learn today do exactly that—but for your computer's file system.

Here's what makes this lesson critical: **professional developers spend 30-40% of their time managing files and folders**. Before you write a single line of code, you need a well-organized project structure. Before you deploy an AI-powered app, you need to know which files to include (and which to delete). The commands you learn today are foundational skills you'll use every single day.

## Part 1: Navigation Commands — Moving Through Your File System

### Understanding File System Structure

Your computer's file system is like a tree:
- **Root directory** (`/` on Mac/Linux, `C:\` on Windows) — the trunk
- **Folders** (directories) — branches
- **Files** — leaves

Every location has a **path**. Think of it like a street address:
- **Absolute path** — full address from root: `/Users/alex/projects/my-app`
- **Relative path** — directions from where you are: `../documents` (go up one level, then into documents)

**Special symbols you'll use:**
- `.` — current directory (where you are now)
- `..` — parent directory (one level up)
- `~` — your home directory (shortcut to `/Users/your-name`)

### Command 1: `pwd` — Print Working Directory

**What it does**: Shows your current location (absolute path).

**When to use it**:
- When you're lost and need to know where you are
- Before running destructive commands (to avoid mistakes)
- When debugging path issues

**Example:**

```bash
pwd
# Output (Mac/Linux): /Users/alex/projects
# Output (Windows Git Bash): /c/Users/Alex/projects
```

**Pro tip**: Run `pwd` before using `rm` (delete) commands. Always know where you are before deleting files.

---

### Command 2: `cd` — Change Directory

**What it does**: Moves you to a different folder.

**Syntax**:

```bash
cd <path>          # Move to specific folder
cd ~               # Move to home directory
cd ..              # Move up one level
cd ../..           # Move up two levels
cd -               # Move to previous directory (like "back" button)
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Move to home directory
cd ~
pwd
# Output: /Users/alex

# Move to projects folder
cd projects
pwd
# Output: /Users/alex/projects

# Move up one level
cd ..
pwd
# Output: /Users/alex

# Move to specific path (absolute)
cd /Users/alex/documents/reports
pwd
# Output: /Users/alex/documents/reports

# Go back to previous location
cd -
# Returns to /Users/alex
```

**Common mistakes:**

```bash
# ❌ Wrong: spaces in path without quotes
cd my folder
# Error: cd: too many arguments

# ✅ Correct: use quotes for paths with spaces
cd "my folder"
# or
cd my\ folder  # Escape the space
```

**Keyboard shortcut**: Type `cd ~/proj` then press **Tab** — the terminal auto-completes to `cd ~/projects` (if that folder exists). This is called **tab completion** and saves massive amounts of time.

---

### Command 3: `ls` — List Directory Contents

**What it does**: Shows files and folders in the current directory.

**Basic usage:**

```bash
ls
# Output: file1.txt  file2.py  my-folder  README.md
```

**Useful flags** (options that modify behavior):

| Flag | What it does | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| `-l` | Long format (detailed info: permissions, size, date) | `ls -l` |
| `-a` | Show hidden files (start with `.`) | `ls -a` |
| `-h` | Human-readable file sizes (KB, MB, GB) | `ls -lh` |
| `-t` | Sort by modification time (newest first) | `ls -lt` |
| `-r` | Reverse order | `ls -lr` |

**Combining flags:**

```bash
# Show all files (including hidden) in long format with human-readable sizes
ls -lah

# Output:
# drwxr-xr-x  5 alex  staff   160B Oct 31 10:23 .
# drwxr-xr-x  8 alex  staff   256B Oct 30 14:15 ..
# -rw-r--r--  1 alex  staff    45B Oct 31 09:12 .gitignore
# -rw-r--r--  1 alex  staff   1.2K Oct 31 10:23 README.md
# drwxr-xr-x  3 alex  staff    96B Oct 30 15:00 src
```

**Reading `ls -l` output** (from left to right):
- `drwxr-xr-x` — Permissions (d=directory, r=read, w=write, x=execute)
- `5` — Number of links
- `alex` — Owner
- `staff` — Group
- `160B` — Size (160 bytes)
- `Oct 31 10:23` — Last modified date/time
- `.` — Filename (`.` is current directory)

**Pro tip**: Use `ls -lah` as your default. It shows everything you need: hidden files, sizes, dates, permissions.

## Part 2: Creating Files and Folders

### Command 4: `mkdir` — Make Directory

**What it does**: Creates new folders.

**Syntax**:

```bash
mkdir <folder-name>           # Create single folder
mkdir folder1 folder2 folder3 # Create multiple folders
mkdir -p path/to/nested/folders  # Create nested folders (parents too)
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Create a single folder
mkdir my-project
ls
# Output: my-project/

# Create multiple folders at once
mkdir src tests docs
ls
# Output: docs/  my-project/  src/  tests/

# Create nested folders (without -p, this fails if parents don't exist)
mkdir -p my-app/src/components
# Creates: my-app/
#          └── src/
#              └── components/

# Verify structure
ls -R my-app
# Output:
# my-app:
# src
#
# my-app/src:
# components
#
# my-app/src/components:
```

**Common mistake:**

```bash
# ❌ Wrong: trying to create nested folders without -p
mkdir projects/python/my-app
# Error: mkdir: projects: No such file or directory

# ✅ Correct: use -p flag
mkdir -p projects/python/my-app
```

**Pro tip**: Always use `mkdir -p` for project structures. It's safe (doesn't fail if folders already exist) and creates all necessary parent directories.

---

### Command 5: `touch` — Create Empty File

**What it does**: Creates an empty file (or updates timestamp of existing file).

**Syntax**:

```bash
touch <filename>              # Create single file
touch file1.txt file2.py file3.md  # Create multiple files
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Create a Python file
touch main.py
ls -lh
# Output: -rw-r--r--  1 alex  staff     0B Oct 31 11:00 main.py

# Create multiple files
touch README.md requirements.txt .gitignore
ls -a
# Output: .gitignore  README.md  main.py  requirements.txt

# Update timestamp of existing file
touch README.md
ls -lh README.md
# Output: -rw-r--r--  1 alex  staff     0B Oct 31 11:05 README.md
# (Notice time changed to 11:05)
```

**When to use `touch`**:
- Quickly create placeholder files in project setup
- Update file timestamps (useful for build systems)
- Test file permissions (if you can create a file, you have write access)

---

## Part 3: File Operations — Copying, Moving, and Deleting

### Command 6: `cp` — Copy Files and Folders

**What it does**: Duplicates files or directories.

**Syntax**:

```bash
cp <source> <destination>     # Copy file
cp -r <source-dir> <dest-dir> # Copy directory (recursive)
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Copy a file
cp README.md README-backup.md
ls
# Output: README-backup.md  README.md

# Copy file to different directory
cp main.py src/
ls src/
# Output: main.py

# Copy directory (requires -r flag)
cp -r src src-backup
ls
# Output: src/  src-backup/

# Copy multiple files to directory
cp file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt docs/
ls docs/
# Output: file1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt
```

**Important**: The `-r` flag means **recursive** (copy everything inside the directory, including subdirectories).

---

### Command 7: `mv` — Move or Rename Files

**What it does**: Moves files/folders to new location OR renames them.

**Syntax**:

```bash
mv <source> <destination>     # Move or rename
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Rename a file (move to same directory with new name)
mv old-name.txt new-name.txt
ls
# Output: new-name.txt

# Move file to different directory
mv main.py src/
ls src/
# Output: main.py

# Move and rename simultaneously
mv config.json src/config-backup.json
ls src/
# Output: config-backup.json

# Move directory (no -r needed for mv)
mv src-backup old-versions/
ls old-versions/
# Output: src-backup/
```

**Key difference from `cp`**: `mv` removes the original file/folder. Use `mv` when you want to reorganize; use `cp` when you need both original and copy.

---

### Command 8: `rm` — Remove Files and Directories ⚠️

**What it does**: Permanently deletes files and folders.

**⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING ⚠️**

**`rm` is PERMANENT. There is NO Undo. No Recycle Bin. No recovery.** Once you run `rm`, the file is gone forever (unless you have backups).

**Syntax**:

```bash
rm <file>                     # Delete file
rm -r <directory>             # Delete directory (recursive)
rm -rf <directory>            # Delete directory (force, no confirmation)
```

**Safe usage examples:**

```bash
# Delete a single file (safe)
rm temp.txt
# File deleted permanently

# Delete multiple files
rm file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

# Delete empty directory
rmdir empty-folder  # Only works if folder is empty

# Delete directory with contents (use with caution!)
rm -r old-project
# Deletes old-project/ and everything inside
```

**DANGEROUS usage (avoid unless you're 100% certain):**

```bash
# ❌ DANGER: Force delete without confirmation
rm -rf my-folder
# Deletes everything instantly, no questions asked

# ❌ CATASTROPHIC: Delete everything in current directory
rm -rf *
# Deletes ALL files and folders in current directory

# ❌ SYSTEM-DESTROYING: Delete everything on computer (DON'T RUN THIS)
rm -rf /
# Modern systems block this, but older systems would wipe entire drive
```

**Safety practices:**

1. **Always run `pwd` before `rm`** — Know where you are
2. **Use `ls` first** — Verify what you're about to delete
3. **Avoid `rm -rf`** — Use `rm -r` so you get confirmation prompts
4. **Test with `ls` before running `rm`** — Replace `rm` with `ls` to preview what will be deleted
5. **Use version control (Git)** — If important files are tracked, you can recover them
6. **Create backups** — Before bulk deletions, copy files to safe location

## Part 4: Real-World Scenario — Professional Project Setup

**Scenario**: You're starting a new Python AI project called `sentiment-analyzer`. You need to set up a professional folder structure in under 2 minutes.

**Required structure:**

```
sentiment-analyzer/
├── src/
│   ├── main.py
│   └── utils.py
├── tests/
│   └── test_main.py
├── data/
│   ├── raw/
│   └── processed/
├── docs/
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt
```

**Step-by-step implementation:**

```bash
# Step 1: Create project root
mkdir sentiment-analyzer
cd sentiment-analyzer

# Step 2: Verify location
pwd
# Output: /Users/alex/projects/sentiment-analyzer

# Step 3: Create all folders in one command
mkdir -p src tests data/raw data/processed docs

# Step 4: Create all files
touch src/main.py src/utils.py
touch tests/test_main.py
touch README.md requirements.txt .gitignore

# Step 5: Verify everything
ls -lah
ls src/
ls tests/
```

**Time to complete**: 1-2 minutes (once you practice these commands).

## Next Steps: Forward Bridge to Lesson 3

You've mastered navigation and file management. But you're still doing everything manually. What if you need to search through thousands of lines? Filter and transform text?

**In Lesson 3: Viewing and Searching File Content**, you'll learn to:
- Read file contents without opening editors (`cat`, `less`, `grep`)
- Search for patterns in files and directories
- Chain commands together using pipes (`|`)
- Build powerful data processing workflows

**Action item**: Before Lesson 3, practice Exercise 5 until you can complete it in under 3 minutes without notes.
