# Chapter 7: Bash Essentials for AI-Driven Development

**Total Duration**: 3-4 hours  
**Prerequisites**: Chapter 5 (Claude Code) or Chapter 6 (Gemini CLI)

---

## Welcome to the Command Line

This chapter transforms complete beginners into confident command-line users who can work effectively with AI CLI tools. You'll learn the 90% of Bash commands you'll actually use, plus how to leverage AI for the rest.

**Core Message**: The terminal isn't intimidating—it's just a different interface. With these essential commands and AI assistance, you can accomplish anything you need in development.

---

## Chapter Structure

### Part I: Bash Commands (Lessons 1-5)

Build foundational command-line fluency through direct instruction.

1. **[The Terminal Interface](./01-terminal-interface.md)** (25-30 min)  
   - Understand terminal anatomy and file system hierarchy
   - Navigate with `pwd` and `cd`
   - Master absolute vs. relative paths

2. **[Navigation and File Management](./02-navigation-files.md)** (40-45 min)  
   - List, create, copy, move, and delete files
   - Use wildcards for batch operations
   - Set up professional project structures in <2 minutes

3. **[Viewing and Searching File Content](./03-viewing-searching.md)** (30-35 min)  
   - Read files with `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `less`
   - Search patterns with `grep`
   - Chain commands with pipes (`|`)

4. **[Environment Variables and Package Management](./04-environment-packages.md)** (35-40 min)  
   - Set temporary and permanent environment variables
   - Configure API keys for AI tools
   - Install packages with `pip`, `npm`, `brew`, `apt`

5. **[Process Management and Troubleshooting](./05-processes-troubleshooting.md)** (30-35 min)  
   - Monitor processes with `ps` and `top`
   - Stop stuck processes with `kill`
   - Diagnose common errors (command not found, permission denied)

---

### Part II: AI-Augmented Workflows (Lessons 6-8)

Transition from command memorization to AI-assisted problem-solving.

6. **[Natural Language Prompts for Bash Tasks](./06-natural-language-prompts.md)** (35-40 min)  
   - Describe tasks in plain language
   - Use AI to generate commands
   - Verify and understand before executing

7. **[Professional Bash Habits and Command Patterns](./07-professional-habits.md)** (30-35 min)  
   - Master keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+R, Tab, Ctrl+A/E)
   - Create aliases for common commands
   - Decide when to memorize vs. ask AI

8. **[Real-World AI-Assisted Workflows](./08-real-world-workflows.md)** (35-40 min)  
   - Execute complete project setups
   - Troubleshoot errors systematically
   - Migrate and reorganize files safely

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. **Navigate** the file system confidently using terminal commands
2. **Manage** files, directories, and permissions efficiently
3. **Configure** environment variables and install development tools
4. **Search** and filter file content using pipes and redirection
5. **Troubleshoot** common errors and manage processes
6. **Collaborate** with AI to generate and verify Bash commands
7. **Apply** professional habits (shortcuts, aliases, safety patterns)

---

## Key Concepts

### Commands You'll Master

**Navigation**: `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`  
**File Management**: `mkdir`, `touch`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`  
**Content**: `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `less`, `grep`  
**Environment**: `export`, `source`, `echo`  
**Packages**: `pip`, `npm`, `brew`, `apt`  
**Processes**: `ps`, `top`, `kill`  
**Finding**: `find`, `which`

### The AI-Augmented Approach

This chapter teaches a **balanced philosophy**:

- **Part I (Lessons 1-5)**: Build foundational command knowledge first
- **Part II (Lessons 6-8)**: Learn to extend capabilities with AI assistance

**NOT**: "Let AI do everything" (you won't learn)  
**NOT**: "Memorize every command" (inefficient)  
**YES**: "Master core skills, use AI as a learning partner"

## Success Criteria

After completing this chapter, you should be able to:

- [ ] Navigate to any directory and list contents in <10 seconds
- [ ] Set up a professional project structure in <2 minutes
- [ ] Configure API keys that persist across sessions
- [ ] Search log files for errors and count occurrences
- [ ] Diagnose and fix "command not found" errors
- [ ] Use AI to generate commands, then verify before executing
- [ ] Apply safety patterns to prevent data loss

## Next Steps

After mastering Bash, you'll apply these skills in:

- **Chapter 8: Git & GitHub** — Version control using terminal commands
- **Python Chapters** — Running scripts, managing packages, virtual environments
- **Project Work** — Automating tasks, deploying applications, managing servers

**Bash is the foundation** for everything that follows.

## Getting Started

Begin with **[Lesson 1: The Terminal Interface](./01-terminal-interface.md)** →

## Quick Reference Card

Keep this nearby as you work:

**Navigation:**
```bash
pwd                    # Where am I?
cd <path>              # Go somewhere
ls -lah                # List everything
```

**File Management:**
```bash
mkdir -p path/to/dir   # Create directories
touch file.txt         # Create file
cp source dest         # Copy
mv source dest         # Move/rename
rm file.txt            # Delete (careful!)
```

**Content:**
```bash
cat file.txt           # Show file
grep "pattern" file    # Search
command1 | command2    # Pipe output
command > file         # Save output
```

**Environment:**
```bash
export VAR="value"     # Set variable
echo $VAR              # View variable
nano ~/.bashrc         # Edit config
source ~/.bashrc       # Reload config
```

**Troubleshooting:**
```bash
which command          # Find location
ps aux | grep name     # Find process
kill -9 PID            # Stop process
chmod +x script.sh     # Add execute permission
```

**Safety:**
- Always run `pwd` before `rm`
- Use `ls` before `rm` to preview
- Avoid `rm -rf` unless certain
- Test AI commands in sandbox first
- Keep backups (use Git!)
