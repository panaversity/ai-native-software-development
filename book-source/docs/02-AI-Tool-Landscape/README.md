# Part 2: AI Tool Landscape

## Purpose

Become proficient with the AI development tools you'll use every day. Gain hands-on experience with Claude Code and Gemini CLI, master command-line fundamentals, and establish professional version control workflows that keep your code safe when working with AI agents.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Part 2, you will:

**Tool Literacy**:
- ✅ Install and use Claude Code with subagents, agent skills, and MCP integrations
- ✅ Install and use Gemini CLI as a free, open-source alternative
- ✅ Understand each tool's strengths, limitations, and ideal use cases
- ✅ Make informed decisions about which tool to use for different tasks

**CLI & Development Fundamentals**:
- ✅ Navigate the command line confidently (Bash essentials)
- ✅ Set up API keys and environment variables securely
- ✅ Request AI tools to execute commands via natural language prompts

**Professional Workflows**:
- ✅ Initialize Git repositories and manage version control
- ✅ Create branches for safe experimentation with AI-generated code
- ✅ Use pull requests to review and merge AI-assisted changes
- ✅ Build a GitHub portfolio demonstrating professional development practices

## Chapters in This Part

**5. How It All Started: The Claude Code Phenomenon**
- Origin story and why Claude Code "changed everything"
- Installation (CLI and web interface)
- Subagents, agent skills, output styles, and MCP servers
- Real-world Claude Code workflows

**6. Google Gemini CLI: Open Source and Everywhere**
- Gemini CLI's open-source nature and free tier
- Installation and authentication
- Gemini 2.5 Pro's 1 million token context window
- Extensions (Gemini CLI equivalent to Claude Code Skills)
- Honest comparison: Claude Code vs. Gemini CLI

**7. Bash Essentials for AI-Driven Development**
- **Part I**: Core Bash commands (navigation, file operations, environment variables)
- **Part II**: Natural language prompts to request AI tools execute Bash commands
- Practical focus: 90% of AI development workflows covered

**8. Git & GitHub for AI-Driven Development**
- **Part I**: Essential Git commands (init, add, commit, push, branches, pull requests)
- **Part II**: Natural language prompts to request AI tools execute Git workflows
- Why Git is critical when working with AI tools (checkpoints, rollback, code review)
- GitHub as portfolio and backup platform

## Grounding Idea

These chapters treat AI tools as collaborators, not magic. We emphasize:
- **Hands-on installation**: Not just theory—you'll actually set up and use these tools
- **Honest comparison**: Each tool has strengths and limitations; we show both
- **Safety first**: Git discipline protects you when AI agents modify code
- **Learning WITH AI**: You don't memorize Bash or Git commands; you learn to request AI tools help you
- **Two-part structure**: Concrete commands + natural language prompts (Chapters 7-8) bridge traditional CLI knowledge with modern AI collaboration

## How This Part Works

- **Scaffolding progression**: Heavy support in Chapter 5 (installation, first steps); gradually building independence through tool comparison and CLI mastery
- **Dual modality (Chapters 7-8)**: Part I teaches concrete commands; Part II shows natural language prompts enabling "learning WITH AI"
- **Practical focus**: Real installation steps, actual workflows, portfolio-building activities
- **Platform diversity**: Windows, Mac, and Linux specific instructions with troubleshooting guides
- **Safety emphasis**: Git workflows specifically designed around AI-generated code safety

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Complete **Part 1: Introducing AI-Driven Development** (foundational AI concepts and mindset needed)
- ✅ Basic computer literacy (file management, terminal familiarity optional)
- ✅ Curiosity about AI development tools

## Estimated Time

- **Chapter 5 (Claude Code)**: 3-4 hours (installation, tutorials, hands-on practice)
- **Chapter 6 (Gemini CLI)**: 2-3 hours (installation, comparison, practice)
- **Chapter 7 (Bash)**: 3-4 hours (Part I commands + Part II natural language workflows)
- **Chapter 8 (Git & GitHub)**: 3-4 hours (Part I workflows + Part II natural language operations)
- **Total Part 2**: 11-15 hours depending on prior experience

## What Comes Next

After completing Part 2, you'll be ready for **Part 3: Python Fundamentals with AI Assistance**, where we begin serious programming with AI tools at your side. You'll have tool proficiency, CLI confidence, and professional workflows in place—the foundation for everything that follows.
