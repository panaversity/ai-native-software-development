# Part 2: AI Tool Landscape


## Purpose

Develop tool literacy and understand the strengths/weaknesses of different AI platforms. Make informed choices about which tool to use for which task.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Part 2, you will:
- Understand Claude Code (IDE integration, strengths, ideal use cases)
- Understand Gemini CLI (command-line workflows, when to prefer)
- Understand GitHub Copilot (inline completion, strengths, integration)
- Make informed tool choices based on task and context
- Know fallback strategies when your preferred tool isn't available

## Chapters in This Part

6. **Claude Code: Features and Workflows** — IDE integration, project context, real-world workflows
7. **Gemini CLI: Installation and Basics** — Command-line setup, prompting via CLI, model selection
8. **GitHub Copilot and Code Editors** — Integration with VS Code/Cursor/Zed, inline suggestions
9. **Choosing the Right Tool for the Task** — Comparison matrix, decision framework, tradeoffs

## Grounding Idea

These chapters treat AI tools as collaborators (not magic), showing honest strengths and limitations of each platform.

## How This Part Works

- **Heavy scaffolding**: Detailed setup guides and step-by-step workflows
- **Tool comparison**: Side-by-side examples showing how each tool approaches the same task
- **Moderate concept density**: 3-5 key concepts per chapter
- **Practical focus**: Real-world scenarios and decision-making frameworks

## Prerequisites

- Complete **Part 1: Introducing AI-Driven Development** (foundational AI concepts needed)

## What Comes Next

After completing Part 2, you'll be ready for **Part 3: Prompt & Context Engineering**, where we master the art of communicating effectively with AI systems.
