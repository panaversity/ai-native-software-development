## Prompt

Create a comprehensive constitution for "CoLearning Python: The AI-Driven Way" Book.

The book is geared towards teaching beginners how to program Modern Python in the new AI Driven Development (AIDD) era.

The book must use Docusaurus to build the book website. The book will also be publish on our website.

Include:

- Book vision and structure
- Mandatory chapter format
- Code standards (Python 3.13+, type hints, testing)
- Show how AI assistants (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, Zed, Cursor) accelerate development
- Show how Spec-Kit accelerate development
- Docusaurus format requirements
- Writing style guidelines
- Quality assurance checklist
- Non-negotiable rules

The book structure will be as follows, consisting of 5 parts and 26 chapters:
- Part 1: Introducing AI-Driven Development (5 chapters)
- Part 2: Spec-Kit Methodology (5 chapters) ‚Üê NEW
- Part 3: AI Tool Landscape (4 chapters) ‚Üê Gemini, Claude, Codex overview
- Part 4: Prompt & Context Engineering (4 chapters)
- Part 5: Modern Python with Type Hints (8 chapters)

Make it detailed enough that Claude Code can reference it for every chapter.

Additionally, finalize the infrastructure architecture:
- 4 Skills (shared guidance frameworks)
- 4 Output Styles (formatting specifications)
- 5 Sub-Agents (collaborative orchestrators)
- Clarify that AI and humans work WITH each other in an iterative SDD loop

## Response snapshot

**Constitution Created (v1.0.0):** Comprehensive 11-section governing document covering:
- Project vision & 5-part book structure (26 chapters)
- 7 core principles (SDD, AI partnership, code quality, progressive pedagogy, consistency, technical accuracy, accessibility)
- Mandatory content structure with chapter checklist
- Writing style & voice guidelines
- AI tool integration standards
- QA workflow & pre-publication checklist
- Non-negotiable rules (what we ALWAYS/NEVER do)
- Governance & amendment procedure
- Success metrics

**Architecture Finalized:**
- **4 Skills:** planning.md, technical-writing.md, pedagogy.md, ai-collaboration.md
- **4 Output Styles:** docusaurus-chapter.md, lesson.md, code-example.md, exercise.md
- **5 Sub-Agents:** planner ‚Üí chapter-writer ‚Üí lesson-writer ‚Üí code-validator ‚Üí technical-reviewer
- **Key Design:** Iterative collaborative loop (humans + AI work together), specification-first approach, shared infrastructure ensures consistency

**Planning Document Updated (pre_plan.md):**
- Clear architecture diagrams and skill/sub-agent descriptions
- 15-file infrastructure inventory
- Design principles explaining separation of concerns
- Distinction between skills (guidance) and sub-agents (orchestrators)

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Architecture is now complete, documented, and ready for implementation. All ambiguities resolved (skills vs sub-agents, human roles vs AI roles, scope boundaries)
- üß™ Tests: No automated tests required for planning/architecture work
- üìÅ Files: 2 files created/modified (.specify/memory/constitution.md, docs/pre_plan.md)
- üîÅ Next prompts: Create 14 remaining infrastructure files (4 skills + 4 output styles + 5 sub-agents + 1 pre-setup spec)
- üß† Reflection: The architecture successfully captures the insight that AI should be treated as a collaborative partner (not a tool to manage), with humans staying immersed in the creative/iterative process. The 5-agent pipeline with clear handoff criteria enables this model while maintaining quality gates.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - planning successfully resolved all architectural questions
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (planning artifact, no automated validation)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): None
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin creating skill files starting with planning.md (most foundational)
