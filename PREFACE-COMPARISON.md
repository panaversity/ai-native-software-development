## Content Mapping

### Section 1: Opening/Hook
**Context**: Poetic, inspirational opening about "teaching machines how to learn with us"
**Published**: Direct, concrete opening about paradigm shift with before/after table

**Winner**: Published (more grounded, less flowery)

### Section 2: Core Concepts
**Context**:
- "Understanding the AI Development Spectrum" (long discussion)
- 3 approaches with multiple bullet points each
- 5 organizational maturity levels (detailed, with progression model)

**Published**:
- "The Three-Part System" (spec, validation, co-learning)
- Tables replacing prose
- Concrete workflow examples

**Winner**: Published (focused on what matters, removes org maturity discussion not needed in Preface)

### Section 3: Practical Guidance
**Context**:
- "What You Will Learn" (learning outcomes)
- "Who This Book Is For" (4 personas with descriptions)
- "How to Use This Book" (reading paths with time estimates)

**Published**:
- "What You'll Actually Do" (13-part structure table)
- "Three Projects You'll Build" (specific, buildable examples)
- "How to Read This Book" (audience-specific table)

**Winner**: Published (shows concrete deliverables, not abstract learning outcomes)

### Section 4: Philosophy & Closing
**Context**:
- "The New Era of Software" section (4 subsections)
- "Thinking Like an AI-Native Developer" (5 subsections)
- "Practice: Thinking in Specifications" exercise

**Published**:
- "A Warning and a Promise" (honest expectations)
- "One More Thing" (meta credibility through self-reference)

**Winner**: Published (more authentic, less prescriptive)

## Strategic Decisions

### What Was Kept
‚úÖ Core idea: Spec ‚Üí AI ‚Üí Validate (Three-Part System)
‚úÖ Three approaches framework (Assisted, Driven, Native)
‚úÖ Bilingual development (Python + TypeScript)
‚úÖ Real projects as motivation

### What Was Cut
‚ùå Organizational maturity levels (5 levels with detailed descriptions)
- **Reason**: Preface should be about reader's journey, not org's journey. This belongs in Part 2+ chapters.

‚ùå Extensive "Why We're Different" discussion
- **Reason**: Lean execution. Reader understands the shift from examples.

‚ùå Educational/pedagogical philosophy sections
- **Reason**: Part 1 establishes this. Preface doesn't need to explain how the book teaches.

### What Was Added
‚úÖ Three concrete projects (Stock Market Analyzer, Customer Support Agent, Multi-Agent Orchestration)
- **Reason**: Readers want to know what they'll build, not abstract concepts

‚úÖ Audience-specific reading paths in table format
- **Reason**: Different readers have different needs. Make it explicit and scannable.

‚úÖ "Warning and Promise" section
- **Reason**: Credibility through honesty. Sets realistic expectations.

‚úÖ Meta-credibility closing
- **Reason**: Shows the book practices what it preaches (specification-driven).
