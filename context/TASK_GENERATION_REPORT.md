**Generated**: 2025-10-29
**Task Checklist**: `specs/001-chapter-2/tasks.md`
**Feature Branch**: `001-chapter-2`
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE AND READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

---

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive implementation task checklist for Chapter 2 has been generated with **47 actionable tasks** organized across **10 implementation phases**, spanning approximately **64 hours of total effort**. All tasks are:

- ✅ Mapped to 4 User Stories (P1, P1, P1, P2 priorities)
- ✅ Aligned with 8 domain skills from the pedagogical toolkit
- ✅ Structured for parallel execution where possible
- ✅ Independently testable with clear acceptance criteria
- ✅ Integrated with chapter scaffolding and book continuity

---

## Task Generation Methodology

### Input Documents Processed

1. **Specification** (`specs/001-chapter-2/spec.md`)
   - 4 User Stories with acceptance scenarios and test criteria
   - 12 Functional Requirements
   - 10 Success Criteria (measurable outcomes)
   - 5 Risk Mitigations
   - 5 Stakeholder Questions addressed

2. **Implementation Plan** (`specs/001-chapter-2/plan.md`)
   - 4-lesson pedagogical structure
   - Learning objectives hierarchy (Bloom's taxonomy)
   - Concept scaffolding strategy (4-level progression)
   - 9 visual asset specifications
   - Domain skill application matrix
   - Chapter integration points

3. **Task Template** (`.specify/templates/tasks-template.md`)
   - Format conventions: [ID] [P?] [Story] Description
   - Phase-based organization
   - Parallel execution opportunities
   - MVP scope recommendations

### Design Principles Applied

1. **User Story Mapping**: Each lesson (Lesson 1-4) maps to one User Story (US1-US4)
2. **Domain Skill Integration**: All 8 skills applied across phases with explicit attribution
3. **Parallel Execution**: Marked [P] tasks have no dependencies and can run in parallel
4. **Independent Testability**: Each lesson independently verifiable against Quick Check questions
5. **Progressive Complexity**: Phases ordered to respect dependencies (foundation before lessons)
6. **Accessibility First**: Quality review embedded in Phase 8 with Constitution Principle 8
7. **Visual Placeholder Strategy**: Separates lesson content (immediate) from visual design (parallel)

## Recommendations

### For Project Managers

1. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Assign lesson-writer subagent for content production (Phases 1-6)
   - Assign instructional designer for assessment and learning objectives (Phase 2)
   - Assign accessibility specialist for review (Phase 8)
   - Assign visual designer for asset creation (Phase 9)

2. **Timeline Optimization**:
   - Critical path: Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Lessons (serial)
   - Parallel opportunities: All 4 lessons can run simultaneously (64h → 16h with 4 people)
   - Visual creation can run in parallel with quality review

3. **Risk Management**:
   - Gate after Phase 2: Require foundation framework approval before lessons
   - Weekly checkpoint: At least one lesson complete before end of Week 1
   - Accessibility validation: Don't wait until end; check first draft for readability

### For Content Writers

1. **Lesson Writing Process**:
   - Start with outline (T013, T017, T024, T030)
   - Reference lesson template for structure
   - Use visual placeholders to guide where visuals should go
   - Embed Quick Checks and reflection prompts as you write
   - Apply all 8 domain skills (see application matrix in tasks.md)

2. **Quality Checkpoints**:
   - Word count validation (target ranges: 1000-1200, 1500-1800, 1200-1400, 800-1000)
   - Learning objective coverage (3-4 LOs per lesson)
   - Jargon definition (all terms defined on first use)
   - Tone consistency (conversational, evidence-based, encouraging)

3. **Visual Integration**:
   - Use placeholder comments to mark where visuals go
   - Write comprehensive placeholder text (100+ words) with all key data
   - Don't wait for final visuals to complete lessons
   - Visuals can be added in parallel after content approval

### For Instructional Designers

1. **Learning Design Validation**:
   - Verify learning objectives follow Bloom's taxonomy (T005)
   - Confirm concept scaffolding is progressive (T006)
   - Validate assessment alignment with LOs (T008)
   - Ensure success criteria are measurable (T043)

2. **Accessibility Compliance**:
   - Review alt text completeness (T040)
   - Validate readability metrics (T041)
   - Confirm multiple reading paths (narrative + tables + Quick Checks)
   - Test visual descriptions with accessibility checker

3. **Integration Validation**:
   - Confirm Chapter 2 builds on Chapter 1 concepts (T011, T042)
   - Verify Chapter 2 prepares for Chapter 3 (T039)
   - Validate book-wide coherence (T042)
