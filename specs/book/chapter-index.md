This document provides chapter titles and topics. For exact file paths, naming conventions, and folder organization, consult `directory-structure.md`.

**Quick Reference**:
- Chapters are **directories** (not files): `book-source/docs/NN-Part-Name/NN-chapter-name/`
- Each chapter contains lesson files: `01-lesson-1.md`, `02-lesson-2.md`, etc.
- Chapter folders use **lowercase-with-hyphens**
- Part folders use **Title-Case-With-Hyphens**

**Examples**:
- Chapter 1: `book-source/docs/01-Introducing-AI-Driven-Development/01-welcome-to-ai-driven-development/`
- Chapter 10: `book-source/docs/04-Python-The-Language-of-AI-Agents/01-functions-types-and-type-hints/`
