# Part 13 Outline: Stateful Agents using Dapr Actors and Dapr Workflows

**Created**: 2025-10-29  
**Part Number**: 13  
**Chapters**: 2 (Chapters 45-46)  
**Status**: Outline for scaffolding

## Part Overview

This final part teaches stateful agent patterns using Dapr Virtual Actors and durable workflows. These patterns enable long-running, stateful agents that survive failures and maintain consistency across distributed systems.

**Target Audience**: Advanced developers building production-scale, stateful agent systems

**Prerequisites**:
- Part 12 (Kafka/Dapr)
- Part 6 (Agentic AI)
- Understanding of distributed systems

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Part 13, readers will be able to:
1. Implement stateful agents with Dapr Virtual Actors
2. Build durable, long-running workflows with Dapr Workflows
3. Handle state consistency in distributed agent systems
4. Design fault-tolerant agent architectures
5. Deploy production-scale stateful agents
