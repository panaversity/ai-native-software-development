# Tasks: Colearning Skills for Python Book Agent

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-colearning-skills/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Integration tests included to validate skill activation and output correctness

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (8 skills = 8 user stories) to enable independent implementation and testing of each skill.
- **6 Core Skills (P1)**: learning-objectives, concept-scaffolding, code-example-generator, exercise-designer, technical-clarity, assessment-builder
- **2 Enhancement Skills (P2)**: book-architecture, ai-augmented-teaching

**Architecture Note**: Skills use Claude Code's model-invoked pattern with progressive disclosure. Scripts are **explicitly invoked via Bash tool** in SKILL.md instructions (not auto-executed). Skill activation is **semantic** (Claude understands context), not keyword-based.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story (skill) this task belongs to (US1-US8)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Skills live in `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/` per Claude Code conventions:
- `SKILL.md` - Core instructions with frontmatter (name, description, allowed-tools)
- `reference/` - Documentation (markdown) - Layer 3, loaded when SKILL.md references them
- `templates/` - Output structures (YAML/markdown) - Layer 3, loaded when needed
- `scripts/` - Validation utilities (Python 3.13+) - Layer 3, invoked via Bash tool

Tests live in `tests/` at repository root.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all skills
- **Core Skills US1-US6 (Phases 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion (Priority P1)
  - Skills can then proceed in parallel (6 developers, 6 skills simultaneously)
  - Or sequentially in priority order
- **Enhancement Skills US7-US8 (Phases 9-10)**: Depend on Foundational phase completion (Priority P2)
  - Can run in parallel with P1 skills if resources available
  - Or implement after P1 skills complete
- **Integration (Phase 11)**: Depends on at least 2 skills complete (recommend all 8 for complete validation)
- **Polish (Phase 12)**: Depends on all skills complete

### Skill (User Story) Dependencies

**P1 Core Skills (Independent after Foundational):**
- **US1 (learning-objectives)**: Can start after Foundational ‚úÖ MVP candidate
- **US2 (concept-scaffolding)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent
- **US3 (code-example-generator)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent (uses sandbox-executor from Foundational)
- **US4 (exercise-designer)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent
- **US5 (technical-clarity)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent (uses readability-analyzer from Foundational)
- **US6 (assessment-builder)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent

**P2 Enhancement Skills (Independent after Foundational):**
- **US7 (book-architecture)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent
- **US8 (ai-augmented-teaching)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent

**KEY INSIGHT**: All 8 skills are completely independent after Foundational phase completes!

### Within Each Skill

1. Create directory structure
2. Create SKILL.md with frontmatter (name, semantic description, allowed-tools)
3. Create reference files (can be parallel)
4. Create templates (can be parallel)
5. Implement standalone scripts
6. Write unit tests for scripts
7. Update SKILL.md with complete instructions (including explicit script invocations and reference doc loading)
8. Write integration test for semantic skill activation

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: T002, T003, T004, T005, T006 can all run in parallel

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T008, T009, T010, T011, T012 can run in parallel after T007

**Phase 3-10 (All 8 Skills)**:
- All 8 skill phases can run in parallel with 8 developers
- Can also run as P1 (6 skills) first, then P2 (2 skills) second
- Within each skill: reference files, templates, and unit tests can run in parallel
- Example for learning-objectives: T015, T016, T017, T018 can all run in parallel
- Example for book-architecture: T080, T081, T082, T083, T084, T085 can all run in parallel

**Phase 12 (Polish)**: T111, T112, T113, T114, T115 can all run in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only - learning-objectives)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T006)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T007-T012) **‚Üê CRITICAL BLOCKER**
3. Complete Phase 3: learning-objectives skill (T013-T022)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test learning-objectives independently
   - Try: "Define objectives for Python decorators" (semantic request)
   - Verify: 3-5 objectives produced, Bloom's levels applied, prerequisites identified
5. Deploy/demo if ready - **This is a viable MVP!**

### Incremental Delivery (Add Skills One at a Time)

**P1 Core Skills (Essential):**
1. Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add learning-objectives ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add concept-scaffolding ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add code-example-generator ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add exercise-designer ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add technical-clarity ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Add assessment-builder ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo

**P2 Enhancement Skills (Optional):**
8. Add book-architecture ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (for comprehensive book projects)
9. Add ai-augmented-teaching ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (for AI-enhanced curriculum)

Each skill adds value without breaking previous skills.

### Parallel Team Strategy (8 Developers - Full Implementation)

With 8 developers for all 8 skills:

1. Team completes Setup (Phase 1) together (T001-T006)
2. Team completes Foundational (Phase 2) together (T007-T012) **‚Üê CRITICAL**
3. Once Foundational is done, **split into 8 parallel tracks**:
   - Developer A: learning-objectives (T013-T022)
   - Developer B: concept-scaffolding (T023-T032)
   - Developer C: code-example-generator (T033-T042)
   - Developer D: exercise-designer (T043-T054)
   - Developer E: technical-clarity (T055-T065)
   - Developer F: assessment-builder (T066-T077)
   - Developer G: book-architecture (T078-T090)
   - Developer H: ai-augmented-teaching (T091-T103)
4. All skills complete independently and simultaneously
5. Reconvene for Integration testing (Phase 11) and Polish (Phase 12)

**Timeline with 8 developers**: ~3-4 days
- Day 1: Setup + Foundational (everyone)
- Days 2-3: Parallel skill implementation (8 tracks)
- Day 4: Integration + Polish

**Timeline with 6 developers** (P1 first, then P2): ~4-5 days
- Day 1: Setup + Foundational (everyone)
- Days 2-3: P1 skills in parallel (6 tracks)
- Day 4: P2 skills in parallel (2 tracks, 4 developers idle or helping)
- Day 5: Integration + Polish

**Timeline with 1 developer**: ~14-16 days (sequential implementation of all 8 skills)

## Key Architectural Corrections from Original

**‚úÖ CORRECTED**:
1. **Skill activation**: Semantic context-based (not keyword triggers)
2. **Script execution**: Explicitly invoked via Bash tool in SKILL.md instructions (not auto-executed)
3. **Shared utilities**: Standalone invocable scripts (not importable modules)
4. **Descriptions**: Contextual semantic explanations (not trigger phrase lists)
5. **Frontmatter**: Added `allowed-tools` field to all skills
6. **Progressive disclosure**: Clarified Layer 1/2/3 architecture
7. **Integration tests**: Test semantic activation, not keyword matching

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies on incomplete work
- [Story] label (US1-US8) maps task to specific skill for traceability
- Each of 8 skills is independently completable and testable
- Tests validate semantic skill activation and output correctness
- Foundational phase (T007-T012) is CRITICAL - nothing else can start until complete
- All 8 skills can be built in parallel after Foundational phase (or P1 first, then P2)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate skill independently
- Hard failure mode (per clarification #1) means validation errors must be clear and actionable
- Scripts output structured data (JSON/YAML) that Claude interprets via SKILL.md instructions
