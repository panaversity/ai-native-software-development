## Prompt

/sp.clarify @specs/001-colearning-skills/spec.md

## Response snapshot

Executed clarification workflow to identify and resolve ambiguities in the colearning skills specification.

**Coverage Analysis Results:**
- Analyzed spec across 10 taxonomy categories (Functional Scope, Domain Model, UX Flow, Non-Functional Attributes, Integration, Edge Cases, etc.)
- Identified 3 Partial categories requiring clarification: Interaction/UX Flow, Integration/Dependencies, Edge Cases/Failure Handling

**5 Critical Questions Asked & Answered:**

1. **Error Handling Strategy** ‚Üí User selected: Hard failure with user intervention required
   - Integrated into FR-034 (new requirement)
   - Aligns with pedagogical tool transparency

2. **Supporting File Formats** ‚Üí User selected: Mixed (markdown for docs, Python for scripts, YAML for data)
   - Integrated into FR-032 and Dependencies & Constraints
   - Enables effective progressive disclosure with appropriate tools per purpose

3. **Code Validation Method** ‚Üí User selected: Execution in sandbox with isolation
   - Integrated into FR-011 and Dependencies & Constraints
   - Added sandbox security requirements (file system, network, resource limits)
   - Updated SC-007 success criteria

4. **Output Format Standardization** ‚Üí User provided: No specific format prescribed (following Anthropic docs)
   - Integrated into FR-030
   - Allows each skill to use most appropriate format for its purpose

5. **Skill Conflict Resolution** ‚Üí User selected: A + D (mutually exclusive descriptions; sequential activation when multiple relevant)
   - Integrated into FR-029 and FR-035 (new requirement)
   - Added guidance for skill description writing

**Sections Modified:**
- New "Clarifications" section with Session 2025-10-28
- Functional Requirements: Updated FR-011, FR-029, FR-030, FR-032; added FR-034, FR-035
- Success Criteria: Updated SC-007
- Dependencies & Constraints: Added sandbox security details, file organization specs
- Edge Cases: Added 2 sandbox-related edge cases

**Coverage After Clarification:**
- Interaction & UX Flow: Partial ‚Üí Resolved
- Integration & Dependencies: Partial ‚Üí Resolved
- Edge Cases & Failure Handling: Partial ‚Üí Resolved

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Resolved all critical spec ambiguities. 5/5 high-impact questions answered and integrated. Spec now has sufficient clarity for architectural planning.
- üß™ Tests: Each clarification validated for consistency; no contradictory statements remain; markdown structure intact
- üìÅ Files: Updated specs/001-colearning-skills/spec.md (6 requirements added/modified, 1 new section, edge cases expanded)
- üîÅ Next prompts: Run /sp.plan to create architectural design; observability and sandbox implementation details deferred to planning phase
- üß† Reflection: Hard failure mode (user's choice) differs from my recommendation but makes sense for critical educational tools where errors should never be silent. Sandbox execution adds complexity but ensures code examples are truly runnable.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all 5 questions answered successfully, integrations completed without conflicts
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - Spec consistency validated after each integration; all clarifications properly integrated into appropriate sections
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): During /sp.plan, validate that sandbox isolation requirements are implementable with available tools (Docker, subprocess, etc.) and don't create unreasonable deployment complexity
