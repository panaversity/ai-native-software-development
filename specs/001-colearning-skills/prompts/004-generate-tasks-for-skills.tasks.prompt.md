tests:
  - Task format validation: All 103 tasks follow strict checklist format with ID, optional [P], optional [Story], description + file path
  - User story mapping: Each of 6 skills mapped to independent user story (US1-US6)
  - Dependency validation: Foundational phase blocks all skills; skills are independent of each other
  - Parallel opportunity identification: 40+ tasks marked [P] for parallel execution

## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task decomposition for implementing 6 colearning skills for Python book agent.

**Approach**: Organized tasks by user story (1 skill = 1 user story) to enable independent implementation and testing

**Task Organization**:

**Phase 1: Setup** (6 tasks)
- Project initialization: directory structure, Python environment, tooling

**Phase 2: Foundational** (7 tasks) ⚠️ CRITICAL BLOCKER
- Shared utilities: YAML loader, markdown parser, sandbox executor, validation helpers
- ALL skills depend on this phase completing first
- No skill work can start until T007-T013 complete

**Phase 3-8: Skills** (71 tasks total, organized by user story)
- Each skill gets its own phase with 10-13 tasks
- Tasks within each skill: directory → SKILL.md → reference files → templates → scripts → tests → integration test
- **KEY INSIGHT**: All 6 skills are completely independent after Foundational phase
- Can be implemented in parallel with 6 developers OR sequentially in any order

Skill breakdown:
- Phase 3 (US1): learning-objectives (11 tasks) - MVP candidate
- Phase 4 (US2): concept-scaffolding (10 tasks)
- Phase 5 (US3): code-example-generator (13 tasks, includes sandbox integration)
- Phase 6 (US4): exercise-designer (12 tasks)
- Phase 7 (US5): technical-clarity (13 tasks)
- Phase 8 (US6): assessment-builder (12 tasks)

**Phase 9: Integration** (5 tasks)
- Sequential multi-skill workflows
- Activation accuracy testing
- Conflict prevention validation

**Phase 10: Polish** (14 tasks)
- Schema validation, formatting, type checking, linting
- Documentation updates
- Performance validation
- Final acceptance testing

**Total**: 103 tasks
**Parallel opportunities**: 40+ tasks marked [P]
**MVP scope**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (learning-objectives only) = 24 tasks

**Implementation Strategies Documented**:

1. **MVP First** (1 skill): Setup → Foundational → learning-objectives → Validate → Deploy
   - Timeline: ~3-4 days with 1 developer
   - Delivers: Functional objective-generation skill (viable MVP)

2. **Incremental Delivery** (add skills one at a time): Foundation + Skill 1 → Test → Deploy → Add Skill 2 → Test → Deploy...
   - Timeline: ~10-12 days with 1 developer
   - Each skill adds value without breaking prior skills

3. **Parallel Team** (6 developers): Setup + Foundational together → 6 skills in parallel → Integration + Polish
   - Timeline: ~3-4 days with 6 developers
   - Day 1: Setup + Foundational (blocking)
   - Days 2-3: All 6 skills simultaneously
   - Day 4: Integration + Polish

**Dependencies Identified**:
- Setup → Foundational → ALL Skills (blocking chain)
- Skills → Integration (at least 2 skills needed)
- All skills → Polish

**Within-skill dependencies**: Directory → SKILL.md → Reference files (parallel) → Scripts → Tests → Integration test

**Success Criteria Mapping**:
- Each skill phase includes integration test validating its success criteria (SC-005 to SC-010)
- Activation tests validate SC-003 (>80% accuracy)
- Performance validation task (T101) validates timing targets
- Final validation (T103) ensures all acceptance scenarios pass

**Format Compliance**: All 103 tasks follow strict format:
- `- [ ] T### [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- Story labels (US1-US6) map tasks to skills
- [P] marks parallel-capable tasks
- Exact file paths included in descriptions

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task decomposition enabling immediate implementation. 103 tasks organized by user story for independent development. Clear MVP path (24 tasks), incremental delivery strategy, and parallel team strategy documented.
- 🧪 Tests: Integration tests included for each skill (6 total) + sequential activation tests (3) + performance validation + final acceptance tests
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md (comprehensive 103-task implementation plan)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run /sp.implement to begin implementation, starting with MVP (learning-objectives skill) or full parallel implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Key insight: all 6 skills are completely independent after Foundational phase completes. This enables true parallel development. Foundational phase (sandbox executor, shared utilities) is the critical blocker - must complete first. Each skill is a complete, independently testable increment.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - task decomposition successful, dependencies clearly identified
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All 103 tasks follow format, user stories mapped correctly, dependencies validated, parallel opportunities identified (40+ tasks)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): During implementation, validate that Foundational phase sandbox executor works across platforms (Windows/macOS/Linux) before building dependent code-example-generator skill
