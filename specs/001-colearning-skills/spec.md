# Feature Specification: Build Colearning Skills for Python Book Agent

**Feature Branch**: `001-colearning-skills`
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build skills for Python colearning book agent. We will build following skills: planning.md, technical-writing.md, pedagogy.md, ai-collaboration.md for Claude Code Skills."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Educators Define Multi-Lesson Plans (Priority: P1)

Educators need to create comprehensive learning plans for multi-chapter Python books with clear learning objectives, progression sequences, and assessment strategies. They should be able to outline how lessons build on each other and specify what students should learn at each stage.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability that enables all other features. Without planning skill, educators cannot structure coherent learning experiences.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by an educator creating a complete lesson plan structure for a chapter and verifying that the planning skill produces a coherent progression with clear objectives, prerequisites, and assessment methods.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an educator inputs book chapter topics and learning goals, **When** they invoke the planning skill, **Then** the system produces a structured lesson plan with sequenced learning objectives, prerequisite knowledge, and assessment strategies.
2. **Given** a learning plan exists, **When** an educator reviews it, **Then** they can verify that lessons are ordered by complexity and prerequisites are correctly identified.

### User Story 2 - Authors Create Technical Content with Clarity (Priority: P1)

Authors need to write clear, accurate technical explanations for Python concepts that are accessible to learners at various skill levels. They should receive guidance on explaining complex concepts, providing examples, and structuring explanations logically.

**Why this priority**: High-quality technical writing is essential for student comprehension. Poor explanations lead to confusion and abandoned learning.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by an author writing a technical explanation of a Python concept (e.g., decorators, async/await) and the writing skill providing feedback on clarity, completeness, and pedagogical effectiveness.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an author provides a draft explanation of a technical concept, **When** the technical-writing skill is invoked, **Then** the system identifies unclear passages, suggests improvements for accessibility, and ensures code examples are accurate.
2. **Given** a technical explanation needs examples, **When** the author requests example generation, **Then** the system produces runnable code examples with clear output demonstrations.

---

### User Story 3 - Educators Apply Evidence-Based Teaching Strategies (Priority: P1)

Educators need guidance on applying pedagogical principles (like spaced repetition, active recall, scaffolding) to their Python teaching materials. They should understand how to structure content for maximum learning retention and engagement.

**Why this priority**: Pedagogy directly impacts learning outcomes. Without pedagogically sound design, high-quality technical content still fails to produce learning.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by an educator designing learning activities (exercises, quizzes, projects) and the pedagogy skill validating that the activities apply evidence-based teaching strategies and are appropriate for the learning objectives.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a learning objective and proposed exercises, **When** the pedagogy skill is invoked, **Then** the system identifies which evidence-based strategies are applied (spaced repetition, interleaving, retrieval practice) and suggests enhancements.
2. **Given** a lesson structure, **When** evaluated for scaffolding effectiveness, **Then** the system confirms that difficulty progression is appropriate and support is provided at the right points.

### User Story 4 - Claude Code Users Leverage AI Collaboration Effectively (Priority: P2)

Users of Claude Code need guidance on how to work effectively with AI tools throughout the learning content development process—from planning to writing to review. They should understand how to prompt effectively, iterate on AI suggestions, and maintain quality control.

**Why this priority**: While essential for modern content development, users can initially work without this guidance (P1 stories can be completed). This skill enhances the workflow but isn't a blocker.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by a user working through a typical content development workflow (planning → writing → review) and the ai-collaboration skill providing guidance on effective prompting, iteration, and quality assurance at each stage.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is stuck during the planning phase, **When** they request AI collaboration guidance, **Then** the system suggests effective prompt structures and provides examples of how to get better AI assistance.
2. **Given** an author receives AI-generated suggestions, **When** they apply the ai-collaboration skill, **Then** the system provides a framework for evaluating and iterating on AI outputs to ensure quality and fit.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an educator has a non-standard Python curriculum (e.g., focusing on data science or web development) rather than general Python?
- How does the planning skill handle very short courses (1-3 lessons) versus comprehensive courses (30+ lessons)?
- What if technical content needs to explain deprecated Python features or legacy code patterns?
- How should the pedagogy skill adapt to different learning modalities (self-paced online, classroom, hybrid)?
- What happens when an educator provides conflicting requirements (e.g., depth vs. time constraints)?

## Assumptions

- **Learning level**: Content is assumed to target beginner to intermediate Python learners unless specified otherwise.
- **Technical accuracy**: Planning and pedagogy skills assume that base technical content is accurate; they focus on structure and pedagogy, not deep technical validation.
- **Integration model**: Skills integrate with Claude Code's command system (slash commands or skill invocation); no custom infrastructure is required.
- **Evidence-based strategies**: Pedagogy skill recommendations are based on established educational research (Bloom's taxonomy, cognitive load theory, spacing effect, interleaving, etc.).
- **AI collaboration audience**: AI-collaboration skill assumes users have basic familiarity with AI tools and are seeking to deepen their effectiveness.

## Dependencies & Constraints

- **Skill framework**: Implementation depends on Claude Code skill infrastructure being available and stable.
- **Python domain knowledge**: Skills require understanding of Python-specific pedagogy and best practices.
- **No external databases**: Skills operate on provided content and context; they do not require external knowledge bases or APIs.
- **Single-turn interactions**: Skills are designed to provide guidance in response to direct requests; they do not maintain state across multiple interactions (though they may reference prior artifacts provided by the user).

## Out of Scope

- Implementation of an automated learning management system (LMS) or student enrollment system.
- Automatic grading of student submissions (pedagogy skill provides guidance only).
- Real-time collaboration or multi-user editing (each skill is independent).
- Integration with specific textbook platforms or publishing systems.
- Translation to non-English languages.

## Scope Clarifications

This feature builds **Claude Code skills** (callable modules) rather than standalone applications. Each skill is invoked independently through Claude Code's interface and provides targeted guidance for a specific phase of content development:

1. **Planning.md**: Structures learning design (objectives, sequencing, assessment)
2. **Technical-writing.md**: Enhances clarity and completeness of explanations
3. **Pedagogy.md**: Applies evidence-based teaching strategies
4. **AI-collaboration.md**: Guides effective AI tool usage throughout development

All four skills work with content about Python but are designed to be applicable to any programming language with minimal modifications.
