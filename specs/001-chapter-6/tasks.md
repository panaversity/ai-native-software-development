# Tasks: Chapter 6 - Gemini CLI: Installation and Basics

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-chapter-6/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md (7 user stories with priorities P1-P3)

**Organization**: Tasks organized by lesson/phase for educational content creation, with user story mappings where applicable.

**Note**: This is a book chapter, not software. Tasks focus on content creation, testing commands, and pedagogical design rather than code implementation.

## ðŸ“‹ IMPORTANT UPDATE: Lesson Consolidation (2025-10-31)

**Change**: Lessons 2, 3, and 4 have been **combined into a single streamlined lesson**: "Installation, Authentication & First Steps" (Lesson 2)

**New Chapter Structure** (4 lessons instead of 6):
1. **Lesson 1**: Why Gemini CLI Matters âœ… COMPLETE
2. **Lesson 2**: Installation, Authentication & First Steps âœ… COMPLETE (consolidates old L2, L3, L4)
3. **Lesson 3**: Built-In Tools Deep Dive (formerly Lesson 5)
4. **Lesson 4**: Context Window & Tool Comparison (formerly Lesson 6)

**Impact**:
- âœ… **Content reduction**: 28% shorter (260 vs 360 lines combined)
- âœ… **User Stories US1 & US2 fully addressed** in combined Lesson 2
- âœ… **Time savings**: ~20 hours development effort saved
- âœ… **Quality improvement**: More scannable (tables, lists), clearer progression
- âœ… **All 8 domain skills applied** in combined lesson

**Files Created**:
- `book-source/docs/02-AI-Tool-Landscape/06-gemini-cli-installation-and-basics/02-installation-authentication-first-steps.md` âœ…
- `history/prompts/001-chapter-6/01-combined-installation-auth-lesson.implement.prompt.md` âœ…

**Tasks Consolidated**: T008-T027 (20 tasks merged into single lesson implementation)

## Follow-Ups & Risks

**Risk 1: Gemini CLI Version Changes**
- **Mitigation**: Document current version (Gemini 2.5 Pro) with update trigger note
- **Action**: Flag chapter for review if Gemini releases major version update

**Risk 2: Installation Dependency Complexity**
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive troubleshooting for Node.js, npm, permissions
- **Action**: Test installations on clean systems with various setups (T051-T053)

**Risk 3: Regional Access Restrictions**
- **Mitigation**: Acknowledge restrictions upfront; mention Qwen Code alternative (T021, T048)
- **Action**: Document regions where Gemini CLI is unavailable

**Risk 4: Learner Overwhelm from Multiple Tools**
- **Mitigation**: Moderate scaffolding; one tool at a time in Lesson 5
- **Action**: Build tool combinations gradually in T039

**Risk 5: Inconsistent Command Output**
- **Mitigation**: Emphasize that Gemini's responses vary; show typical responses
- **Action**: Include multiple example outputs in T024, T054

---

## Next Steps After Task Completion

1. **Technical Review**: Invoke technical-reviewer subagent to validate technical accuracy
2. **Pedagogical Review**: Verify Bloom's progression and learning outcomes met
3. **Integration Verification**: Check flow with Chapters 5, 7, 8
4. **Docusaurus Publication**: Build and publish to book website
5. **Beta Testing**: Gather learner feedback on clarity and exercises
6. **Refinement**: Address feedback and publish final version
