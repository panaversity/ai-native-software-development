---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope (Deliver First)
**User Stories 1-2 (P1 priority)**:
- Lesson 2: Installation (US1)
- Lesson 3: Authentication (US1)
- Lesson 4: First Commands (US2)
- Command verification for US1-US2 only

**Rationale**: Enables learners to install, authenticate, and execute first commands successfully. This is the minimum viable chapter.

### Second Increment
**User Story 6 (P2 priority)**:
- Lesson 1: Why Gemini CLI Matters (US6, US7)
- Lesson 6: Tool Comparison sections (US6)

**Rationale**: Adds strategic context and decision framework for tool selection.

### Third Increment
**User Stories 3-4 (P2 priority)**:
- Lesson 5: Built-In Tools (US3)
- Lesson 6: Context Window (US4)

**Rationale**: Unlocks full Gemini CLI capabilities.

### Final Increment
**User Stories 5, 7 (P3 priority)**:
- Extensions introduction (US5)
- Qwen Code mention (US7)

**Rationale**: Nice-to-have context for advanced learners and ecosystem awareness.

## Follow-Ups & Risks

**Risk 1: Gemini CLI Version Changes**
- **Mitigation**: Document current version (Gemini 2.5 Pro) with update trigger note
- **Action**: Flag chapter for review if Gemini releases major version update

**Risk 2: Installation Dependency Complexity**
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive troubleshooting for Node.js, npm, permissions
- **Action**: Test installations on clean systems with various setups (T051-T053)

**Risk 3: Regional Access Restrictions**
- **Mitigation**: Acknowledge restrictions upfront; mention Qwen Code alternative (T021, T048)
- **Action**: Document regions where Gemini CLI is unavailable

**Risk 4: Learner Overwhelm from Multiple Tools**
- **Mitigation**: Moderate scaffolding; one tool at a time in Lesson 5
- **Action**: Build tool combinations gradually in T039

**Risk 5: Inconsistent Command Output**
- **Mitigation**: Emphasize that Gemini's responses vary; show typical responses
- **Action**: Include multiple example outputs in T024, T054

---

## Next Steps After Task Completion

1. **Technical Review**: Invoke technical-reviewer subagent to validate technical accuracy
2. **Pedagogical Review**: Verify Bloom's progression and learning outcomes met
3. **Integration Verification**: Check flow with Chapters 5, 7, 8
4. **Docusaurus Publication**: Build and publish to book website
5. **Beta Testing**: Gather learner feedback on clarity and exercises
6. **Refinement**: Address feedback and publish final version
