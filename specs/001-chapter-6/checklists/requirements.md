# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 6 - Gemini CLI: Installation and Basics

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

### Validation Results (2025-10-31)

**âœ… All checklist items PASSED**

The specification is complete and ready for the next phase (`/sp.plan`).

**Key Strengths:**
1. **Clear User Scenarios**: 7 prioritized user stories covering installation (P1), configuration (P1), built-in tools (P2), context window understanding (P2), extensions (P3), tool comparison (P2), and Qwen Code alternative (P3)
2. **Comprehensive Requirements**: 15 functional requirements covering all essential aspects (installation, authentication, commands, built-in tools, extensions, comparison, troubleshooting)
3. **Measurable Success Criteria**: 10 specific, technology-agnostic, measurable outcomes (e.g., "install within 15 minutes", "authenticate within 10 minutes", "90% completion rate on first attempt")
4. **Well-Bounded Scope**: Clear in-scope and out-of-scope sections prevent scope creep
5. **Risk Mitigation**: 6 identified risks with specific mitigation strategies
6. **Cross-Chapter Integration**: Clear connections to Chapters 5, 7, 8, and Parts 3-4

**No clarifications needed** - all requirements are clear, testable, and implementable without ambiguity.
