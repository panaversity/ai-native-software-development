# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 2 Redesign - AI Turning Point

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [Chapter 2 Redesign Spec](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs (reader comprehension and engagement)
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders (accessible to programming beginners)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Scope, Dependencies, Risks)

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous (25 functional requirements with specific criteria)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (8 specific outcomes with beta reader metrics)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no code, conceptual chapter)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined (4 user stories with specific Given-When-Then scenarios)
- [x] Edge cases are identified (reader skepticism, overwhelm, confusion)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (In Scope: 6 items, Out of Scope: 6 items)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (Prerequisites, Follow-Up Work, 5 assumptions)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (4 prioritized user stories: P1-P1-P2-P3)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (8 success criteria)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification (conceptual/narrative chapter, no code)

## Constitutional Alignment

- [x] Aligns with Principle 1 (AI-First Teaching): FR-022 requires demonstration of AI collaboration
- [x] Aligns with Principle 7 (Technical Accuracy): FR-005, FR-006, FR-007, FR-024 require verified claims with citations
- [x] Aligns with Principle 8 (Accessibility): FR-018, FR-019, FR-020, FR-021 require Grade 7 reading level, analogies, reflection prompts
- [x] Aligns with Principle 9 (Show-Then-Explain): FR-004 requires evidence/example first, then analysis
- [x] Aligns with Book Gaps Checklist for conceptual chapters: FR-025 explicitly requires alignment

## Notes

**Validation Status**: ✅ **PASSED** (All checklist items met)

**Strengths**:
1. Clear, evidence-based approach with specific data points and sources
2. Comprehensive user stories with measurable acceptance criteria (4 prioritized stories)
3. Strong constitutional alignment addressing accessibility, accuracy, and AI-first teaching
4. Well-defined scope boundaries preventing duplication with Chapters 1 and 3
5. Risk mitigation strategies address likely reader objections (hype skepticism, data dump feel)
6. All 27 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous

**User Decisions Incorporated** (2025-10-30):
- **Q1**: Yes, include "Where Are You Now?" self-assessment in Section 3 (FR-026)
- **Q2**: Present SDD as 7-step overview with brief explanation (FR-010 confirmed)
- **Q3**: Include "Skeptic's Corner" sidebar/callout boxes (FR-027)

**Recommendations for Planning Phase**:
1. ✅ Open Questions Q1-Q3 resolved and incorporated into requirements
2. Confirm beta reader access for testing acceptance scenarios (SC-001 through SC-004)
3. Verify access to all cited source materials (DORA report, Stack Overflow survey, ICPC results, GDPval benchmark)
4. ✅ Skeptic's Corner sidebars will address reader objections throughout chapter

**Readiness Assessment**:
✅ **APPROVED - READY FOR PLANNING PHASE**

This specification is complete, testable, and aligned with constitutional requirements. All open questions have been resolved with user input. The specification is ready to proceed to the chapter-planner subagent for detailed lesson planning and task breakdown.
