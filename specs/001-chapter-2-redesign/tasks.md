## Task Dependencies & Sequencing

```
Phase 1: Content Structure (Tasks 1.1-1.5)
  â†“
Phase 2: Evidence Verification (Tasks 2.1-2.6) & Content Writing (Tasks 3.1-3.5)

## Notes for Lesson-Writer

1. **Tone**: Professional, conversational, engaging. Address readers as peers. Avoid condescension; assume no prior knowledge.

2. **Pacing**: Aim for 6-9 minutes per section. Variety helps: narrative, examples, tables, sidebars, reflection prompts.

3. **Examples**: Real and specific. Names, numbers, outcomes. No abstract frameworks without grounding.

4. **Sidebars**: Skeptic's corners should feel like reader's actual objections, not strawman arguments. Respond with evidence, not dismissal.

5. **Forward Bridges**: Each section should close with "Now that we understand X, the next question is Y..." style transition.

6. **Reflection Prompts**: Open-ended questions that invite self-reflection. Avoid yes/no questions.

7. **Accessibility**: If technical term appears, define it in simple language. Examples are clearer than definitions.

8. **References to Spec-Driven Development**: Keep brief in Section 2. Full formalization comes in Part 5. This is overview.

9. **References to DORA**: Position as external validation of practices, not lesson-writer opinion. Cite the research.

10. **Citations**: Every statistic, benchmark, leadership quote needs source. Format consistently.
