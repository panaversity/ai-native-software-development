## ✅ Correction 2: Employer Skills Demand Percentages

**Changed from**:
```
What employers want (2024 surveys):
- 78% want developers skilled in AI tool usage
- 71% prioritize specification and requirements writing
- 65% seek prompt engineering capabilities
- 58% need candidates with agent orchestration experience
```

**Changed to**:
```
What employers increasingly prioritize (2024-2025 surveys):
- 40% of CEOs plan to hire additional staff because of generative AI (IBM survey, 3,000 CEOs)
- 31% of recruiters now value AI tool knowledge, up 5% from last year (GMAC survey)
- 23% predict AI tools will be the most important skill in the next five years (GMAC survey)
- 7% are actively hiring for prompt engineering roles (McKinsey AI survey)
- Average salary for roles requiring generative AI skills: $174,727 (Indeed)
```

**Also updated CS program statistics** from specific percentages to qualitative statements, as specific curriculum analysis data was not available.

**Sources**: IBM CEO survey, GMAC recruiter survey, McKinsey AI survey, Indeed salary data

**Files updated:**
- ✅ `08-traditional-cs-education-gaps.md` (lines 172-187)

**Total**: 1 major section rewritten with verified data

## ✅ Correction 3: ICPC AI Coding Performance

**Changed from**: "ICPC World Finals competitors (the best human coders on Earth) report that AI tools match or exceed their capabilities on many standard programming tasks"

**Changed to**: "At the 2024 ICPC World Finals, Google DeepMind's Gemini achieved gold-medal level performance, performing as well as the world's top 20 competitive coders—and even solved a problem that no human team could solve"

**Source**: Google DeepMind blog (September 2024)

**Files updated:**
- ✅ `01-the-hook.md` (line 27)

**Total**: 1 instance strengthened with more impressive evidence

## ✅ Correction 4: DORA Productivity Claims

**Changed from**:
```
Productivity impact:
- 70% faster implementation for standard features (enterprise case studies)
- 50% reduction in debugging time (Google DORA research)
- 40% fewer bugs reaching code review (GitHub Copilot metrics)
```

**Changed to**:
```
Productivity impact:

Enterprise organizations using AI tools report productivity gains ranging from modest to substantial. Google's 2024 DORA research (surveying 39,000+ professionals) found that over a third of developers experienced moderate to extreme productivity increases, though the overall impact varies by context and implementation approach. Individual success stories from GitHub, Anthropic, and enterprise deployments demonstrate significant time savings for standard features and debugging tasks.
```

**Source**: Google DORA 2024 Report (https://dora.dev/research/2024/dora-report/)

**Files updated:**
- ✅ `04-development-lifecycle-transition.md` (lines 91-94)

**Total**: 1 section nuanced to reflect mixed research results
