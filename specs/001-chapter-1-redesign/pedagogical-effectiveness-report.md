- Validates multiple perspectives (excitement, concern, skepticism)
- Creates baseline for later comparison ("Has your perspective shifted?")
- Low stakes (explicitly says "no need to write anything down")

**Pedagogical function**: Metacognitive prompt that prepares reader for learning

---

#### Prompt 2: Section 3 (Skepticism)
**Text**: "Does this transformation feel real to you? Or does part of you still think 'this is probably overblown—coding jobs will stay mostly the same'? It's okay to be skeptical. Healthy skepticism protects you from hype. But before moving to the next section, ask yourself: What evidence would you need to see to be convinced that this transformation is as significant as this chapter claims? Keep that question in mind as you continue reading. We'll provide that evidence."

**Purpose**: Address skepticism explicitly; set expectations for evidence

**Effectiveness**: ✅ **Excellent**
- Validates skepticism ("It's okay to be skeptical")
- Reframes skepticism as productive ("What evidence would you need?")
- Creates engagement contract ("We'll provide that evidence")
- Metacognitive (asks reader to clarify their own criteria)

**Pedagogical function**: Transforms passive skepticism into active evaluation; prepares reader for evidence-heavy sections

---

#### Prompt 3: Section 5 (Self-Assessment)
**Text**: "Think about your current role or the role you're preparing for. Which parts of your work (or planned work) are mechanical and repetitive? Which parts require judgment and creativity? As you read the next sections, consider: Are you developing the skills that AI amplifies (judgment, architecture, communication) or the skills that AI automates (syntax, boilerplate, patterns)? There's no judgment here—this is just self-assessment. Understanding where you are helps you figure out where to invest your learning energy."

**Purpose**: Apply framework to personal situation; encourage strategic thinking

**Effectiveness**: ✅ **Excellent**
- Actionable (asks specific questions about current work)
- Non-judgmental ("There's no judgment here")
- Forward-looking (connects to learning strategy)
- Framework-based (mechanical vs judgment work)

**Pedagogical function**: Transforms abstract framework into personal application; guides learning strategy

---

#### Prompt 4: Section 7 (Positioning)
**Text**: "Where do you position yourself in this transformation? Beginner seeing opportunity? Experienced developer staying relevant? Entrepreneur spotting the startup window? Career changer with domain expertise? Whatever your starting point, the opportunity is real. The question is what you do with it."

**Purpose**: Personalize opportunity; motivate action

**Effectiveness**: ✅ **Excellent**
- Offers four distinct identity options (inclusive)
- Affirms opportunity for all ("whatever your starting point")
- Creates urgency ("The question is what you do with it")
- Empowering (reader agency emphasized)

**Pedagogical function**: Transitions from understanding to motivation; prepares for action

---

#### Prompt 5: Section 8 (Perspective Check)
**Text**: "Remember that 'Pause and Reflect' moment from Section 1? We asked which part of Sarah Chen's story resonated with you. Now, after eight sections of evidence, arguments, and examples: Has your perspective shifted?"

**Purpose**: Create closure loop; demonstrate learning

**Effectiveness**: ✅ **Excellent**
- Explicit callback to opening prompt (creates closure)
