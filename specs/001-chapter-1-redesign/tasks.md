## Follow-Ups & Risks

**Risk 1: Chapter overwhelms beginners with evidence/data**
- **Mitigation**: Use storytelling and concrete examples; relegate detailed statistics to citations readers can optionally explore

**Risk 2: Experienced developers dismiss chapter as "too basic"**
- **Mitigation**: Include deeper insights and strategic analysis; cite authoritative sources for credibility

**Risk 3: Skeptical readers reject premise and abandon book**
- **Mitigation**: Address skepticism proactively with verifiable evidence; acknowledge reasonable doubts; provide evidence-based responses

**Risk 4: Field Volatility (AI tools, APIs, capabilities advancing rapidly)**
- **Mitigation**: Flag date-sensitive claims for annual review; mark maintenance trigger points in source doc

**Risk 5: Chapter feels like "hype" rather than serious analysis**
- **Mitigation**: Ground every claim in cited sources; acknowledge limitations; avoid superlatives without evidence

## Next Steps

**After Phase 3 Complete**:
1. Obtain final approval from project stakeholder
2. Address any outstanding feedback from review
3. Prepare content for lesson-writer agent implementation (if applicable)
4. Integrate into Docusaurus build
5. Validate formatting and rendering in actual book structure
