## 1. Core Principles Alignment (11 Principles)

### Principle 1: AI-First Teaching Philosophy ✅

**Requirement**: "Every concept, example, and exercise MUST demonstrate AI-assisted development as the primary workflow, not an afterthought."

**Chapter 1 Compliance**: ✅ **Fully Aligned**

**Evidence**:
- ✅ Section 1: Sarah Chen story demonstrates AI tools as collaborative partner
- ✅ Section 4: All 6 lifecycle phases show AI-augmented approach (not traditional approach alone)
- ✅ Section 5: Developer role evolution from "typist to orchestrator" frames AI as amplifier
- ✅ Section 6: Autonomous agent era shows AI as integral to future workflows
- ✅ Section 8: Explicitly critiques "traditional learn without AI" approach as outdated

**Key Quotes**:
- "With Claude Code guiding her through the implementation..." (Section 1)
- "AI tools are transforming every single phase of the software development lifecycle" (Section 4)
- "You become an orchestrator and editor, not primarily an author" (Section 4)

**Assessment**: ✅ **Exemplary** - AI collaboration positioned as foundational, not optional

---

### Principle 2: Spec-Kit Plus Methodology as Foundation ⚠️

**Requirement**: "Spec-Kit Plus methodology MUST be introduced progressively and applied to all projects and examples."

**Maintenance Note**: Statistics and tool landscape reflect 2024-2025 data. The AI coding field evolves rapidly; review this chapter annually or when major tool versions release for currency.
```

**Priority**: Low (nice to have for long-term maintenance)

---

### Opportunity 2: Spec-Kit Plus Positioning
**Current state**: Spec-Kit mentioned briefly in Sections 5 and 8

**Enhancement**: Add brief preview or teaser in Section 9 bridge:
```markdown
You'll learn Spec-Kit Plus methodology in Part 5, which teaches you how to write clear specifications that AI agents can implement correctly.
```

**Priority**: Low (current positioning is appropriate; this is purely optional enhancement)
