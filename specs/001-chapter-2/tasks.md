## Dependencies & Parallel Execution Strategy

### Critical Path (Blocking Dependencies)

1. **Phase 1 Setup** (4 tasks, 4h) - Must complete first
2. **Phase 2 Foundation** (8 tasks, 10.5h) - MUST complete before lesson writing
   - Learning objectives framework (T005)
   - Concept scaffolding strategy (T006-T007)
   - Assessment design (T008-T009)
3. **Then: Parallel Lesson Implementation** (Phase 3-6)
   - Lesson 1 (3 tasks, 6h) - can proceed independently
   - Lesson 2 (8 tasks, 11.5h) - can proceed independently (with visual designs in parallel)
   - Lesson 3 (5 tasks, 8.5h) - can proceed independently (with visual designs in parallel)
   - Lesson 4 (5 tasks, 7h) - can proceed independently (with visual designs in parallel)
4. **Phase 7 Integration** (4 tasks, 5h) - After all lessons complete
5. **Phase 8 Quality Review** (5 tasks, 6.5h) - Can proceed in parallel with Phase 7 for early feedback
6. **Phase 9 Visual Specs** (2 tasks, 2.5h) - Can proceed in parallel with lesson writing or after
7. **Phase 10 Final** (3 tasks, 3h) - Final checklist, after all substantive work

### Parallelization Opportunities

**Phase 1**: All 4 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
**Phase 2**: All 8 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
**Phase 3-6**: All 4 lessons can be written in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
**Visual Placeholders**: T019-T021, T026-T027, T032-T033 can be written in parallel with lesson content
**Phase 8 Quality**: T040-T041, T044 can run in parallel; T042-T043 can run after lessons complete

### Recommended Execution Order for Single Developer

1. Phases 1-2: Setup + Foundation (14.5h)
2. Phase 3: Lesson 1 complete (6h)
3. Phase 4: Lesson 2 complete (11.5h)
4. Phase 5: Lesson 3 complete (8.5h)
5. Phase 6: Lesson 4 complete (7h)
6. Phase 7: Integration & exercises (5h)
7. Phase 8: Quality review (6.5h)
8. Phase 9: Visual specs (2.5h)
9. Phase 10: Final handoff (3h)
**Total: 64 hours (approximately 8 days at 8h/day)**

### Recommended Execution Order for Multiple Developers

- **Developer A**: Phase 2 Learning Objectives (T005) + Phase 3 Lesson 1 (T013-T016)
- **Developer B**: Phase 4 Lesson 2 + visual placeholders (T017-T023)
- **Developer C**: Phase 5 Lesson 3 + visual placeholders (T024-T029)
- **Developer D**: Phase 6 Lesson 4 + visual placeholders (T030-T035)
- **Together**: Phase 1 Setup, Phase 7 Integration, Phase 8 Quality, Phase 9 Visuals, Phase 10 Final
**Total: 16 hours (parallel, 4 developers)**

---

## MVP Scope Recommendation

**Minimum Viable Chapter (Lesson 1 only)**:

Complete these tasks to have a working, testable Lesson 1:
1. ✅ Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. ✅ Phase 2: Foundation (T005-T012)
3. ✅ Phase 3: Lesson 1 (T013-T016)
4. ✅ Accessibility (T040)
5. ✅ Chapter index for Lesson 1 only (T038)

**Effort**: ~20h
**Outcome**: Lesson 1 complete and publishable; readers understand 2025 inflection point; Quick Checks pass

**Next Increment**: Add Lesson 2 (another 11.5h) → Readers understand technological revolutions

---

## Notes & Risk Mitigations

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Learning Objectives Must Be Clear**: If T005 is incomplete, all lesson writing (T013-T035) will lack focus
2. **Visual Placeholders Must Be Comprehensive**: If T019-T021, T026-T027, T032-T033 lack detail, readers won't understand concepts without graphics
3. **Foundation Phase Completion**: Do NOT start lesson writing until T005-T012 are approved
4. **Consistency Across Lessons**: All lessons must apply all 8 domain skills; use T005-T012 as guardrails

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Information overload (9 revolutions + 4 tools) | High | Lesson 2 scaffolding (3+3+3 grouping) with visual placeholders; readability review (T041) |
| Tool information becomes outdated | Medium | Add "as of October 2025" timestamps; focus on enduring principles; design specs in T046 for easy updates |
| Readers skip Chapter 2 to get to Chapter 3 | Medium | Strong hook in Lesson 1; "Why This Matters" boxes throughout; clear preview of Chapter 3 connection |
| Visual placeholders not comprehensive enough | High | T019-T021, T026-T027, T032-T033 must include all key data; T046 design specs detailed |
| Jargon not accessible | Medium | T007 terminology mapping + T040 clarity review ensures all terms defined |
| Lesson writing without approved framework | High | Gate: Do NOT start T013-T035 until T005-T012 approved |

### Known Assumptions

- Source materials (context/03_chap2_spec/) are complete and accurate
- "As of October 2025" tool information is current (may require updates later)
- Chapter word count limit (5,000 words) can be maintained through editing in lesson writing
- Visual assets can be created in parallel or after content completion
- Readers have completed Chapter 1 (understands mindset shift)

## Quality Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)

Chapter 2 is complete when:

- [ ] All 4 lessons written and meet word count targets (4,500-5,400 total)
- [ ] All learning objectives addressed in content and Quick Checks
- [ ] All 10 success criteria from spec.md have corresponding chapter content
- [ ] All 8 domain skills applied and documented
- [ ] All 9 visual placeholders written with comprehensive alt text
- [ ] All 3 exercises created with model solutions
- [ ] Accessibility score >= 9/10 (alt text, readability, high contrast)
- [ ] Readability score >= 9/10 (Flesch-Kincaid, no gatekeeping language)
- [ ] Chapter passes Constitution alignment check (11 principles)
- [ ] All Quick Checks have model answers
- [ ] Chapter integrates with Chapter 1 (references) and Chapter 3 (previews)
- [ ] No URLs or references that will become outdated within 12 months (except "as of Oct 2025" notes)
- [ ] Tone consistent across all lessons (conversational, evidence-based, encouraging)
- [ ] Files organized per directory structure spec and committed to feature branch

## Next Steps

After tasks are approved:

1. ✅ **Phase 0**: Research complete (`context/03_chap2_spec/`)
2. ✅ **Phase 1**: This task checklist approved
3. ⏭️ **Phase 2**: Assign lesson-writer subagent to:
   - Execute Phase 1 Setup tasks (T001-T004)
   - Execute Phase 2 Foundation tasks (T005-T012)
   - Get approval before proceeding to lesson writing
4. ⏭️ **Phase 3-6**: Invoke lesson-writer subagent to write Lessons 1-4 in parallel (T013-T035)
   - Each lesson independent, testable, reviewable
5. ⏭️ **Phase 7-10**: Integration, quality review, visual specifications, final handoff
6. 🎨 **Visual Asset Creation** (parallel or sequential): Use T046 design specs to create 9 visual assets
7. 📦 **Publication**: Merge to main; integrate visual assets; publish Chapter 2
