# Specification Quality Checklist: Part 1 - Introducing AI-Driven Development

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs (educational content serving learners)
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders (accessible to beginners, educators, decision-makers)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Scope, Dependencies, Risks)

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (specification is comprehensive)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous (28 functional requirements with clear MUST statements)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (18 specific, quantifiable success criteria across 4 categories)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focused on reader outcomes, not implementation)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined (4 user stories with multiple acceptance scenarios each)
- [x] Edge cases are identified (6 edge cases covering reader experience concerns)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (In Scope, Out of Scope, Non-Goals all explicitly defined)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (Internal/External dependencies, 8 assumptions, Prerequisites clearly listed)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria (mapped through user stories and success criteria)
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (4 user stories covering beginners, professionals, educators, decision-makers)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (18 success criteria with specific metrics)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification (content focused on WHAT not HOW)

## Validation Results

**Overall Status**: ✅ PASSED

**Summary**: The specification for Part 1 is comprehensive, well-structured, and ready for the planning phase. All mandatory sections are complete with appropriate detail. The specification successfully balances clarity for non-technical stakeholders while providing sufficient detail for implementation planning.

**Strengths**:
1. **Comprehensive User Coverage**: 4 prioritized user stories covering all key audience segments
2. **Measurable Success Criteria**: 18 specific, quantifiable success criteria across reader comprehension, motivation, content quality, and pedagogical effectiveness
3. **Clear Scope Boundaries**: Explicit In Scope, Out of Scope, and Non-Goals prevent scope creep
4. **Risk Awareness**: 7 identified risks with detailed mitigation strategies
5. **Constitutional Alignment**: Multiple functional requirements explicitly tie to constitution principles
6. **Thorough Dependencies**: Internal and external dependencies clearly mapped

**Key Highlights**:
- 28 functional requirements organized into 5 logical categories (Structure, Content, Constitutional, Pedagogical, Quality)
- 4 chapter entities with specific topics, source material, and reading time estimates
- Edge cases address realistic reader experience concerns (dropout, overwhelm, credibility, expectations)
- Constraints section provides clear guardrails for implementation (technical, content, quality, timeline, resource)
- Open questions flag 10 areas needing clarification or decision during planning

**Readiness Assessment**:
- ✅ Ready for `/sp.clarify` - No critical gaps; open questions are minor and don't block planning
- ✅ Ready for `/sp.plan` - Specification provides sufficient detail for chapter-planner subagent to create comprehensive lesson plans

## Notes

### Spec Quality Observations

**Exceptional Elements**:
- The specification treats Part 1 (4 chapters) as a single cohesive feature while clearly defining each chapter's boundaries
- User stories are genuinely testable with specific acceptance scenarios tied to reader comprehension
- Success criteria span multiple dimensions (comprehension, motivation, quality, pedagogy, production) providing holistic validation
- Risk mitigation strategies are actionable and specific, not generic boilerplate

**Areas for Potential Clarification During Planning**:
1. Video embedding strategy (Question 1) - Affects implementation approach
2. Reflection prompts format (Question 5) - Depends on Docusaurus capabilities
3. Citation style (Question 6) - Needs style guide decision
4. Image/diagram handling (Question 7) - Copyright and quality considerations
5. Beta reader pool composition (Question 8) - Affects validation feasibility

**Constitutional Compliance Preview**:
The specification explicitly references 8 of the 11 constitutional principles:
- Principle 1: AI-First Teaching (implicit in conceptual foundation)
- Principle 2: Spec-Kit Plus (workflow explicitly followed)
- Principle 5: Progressive Complexity (chapter sequencing)
- Principle 6: Consistent Structure (output styles, skills)
- Principle 7: Technical Accuracy (FR-015)
- Principle 8: Accessibility (FR-014)
- Principle 9: Show-Then-Explain (reflection prompts)
- Principle 10: Real-World Projects (conceptual prep for later parts)

**SDD Workflow Adherence**:
The specification correctly identifies this as the "Spec" phase and explicitly states the next phase is "Plan" using the chapter-planner subagent. The workflow dependencies section clearly maps the SDD loop for Part 1 development.

## Recommendations

1. **Proceed to Planning Phase**: The specification is complete and ready. Run `/sp.plan` to engage the chapter-planner subagent.

2. **Address Open Questions During Planning**: The chapter-planner can provide recommendations on questions 1-10 based on pedagogical best practices and Docusaurus capabilities.

3. **Confirm Source Material Access**: Before planning, verify all context files (02-05 folders) are accessible and readable.

4. **Consider Checklist Expansion**: During planning, the chapter-planner may identify additional chapter-level checklists (e.g., one per chapter for granular validation).

5. **Beta Reader Recruitment**: Begin recruiting beta readers in parallel with planning to enable timely validation after implementation.
