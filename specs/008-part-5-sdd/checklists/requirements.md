# Specification Quality Checklist: Part 5 Introduction & Chapter Planning

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-01
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)
**Feature Branch**: `008-part-5-sdd`

---

## Content Quality

- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [ ] Focused on user value and business needs (professional development workflow)
- [ ] Written for appropriate audiences (developers, team leads, instructors)
- [ ] All mandatory sections completed
- [ ] Overview provides clear context and scope

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable and specific
- [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined with Given/When/Then format
- [ ] Edge cases are identified and addressed
- [ ] Scope is clearly bounded (what's IN, what's OUT)
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows (P1, P2, P3 priorities assigned)
- [ ] Each user story is independently testable (can implement one story and still deliver value)
- [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification
- [ ] Part 5 complexity tier (Advanced) correctly applied
- [ ] All chapters explicitly connect to team collaboration and Parts 6+

## Specification-First Alignment

- [ ] Specification emphasizes SDD as methodology, not tool
- [ ] No code examples or framework-specific details included
- [ ] Focuses on WHAT (SDD principles) not HOW (SpecKit implementation)
- [ ] Constitution principles referenced or clearly aligned
- [ ] Pedagogical purpose clear (professional workflow, team adoption, real-world context)

## Part 5 Specific Validation

- [ ] Overview explains Part 5's role in the book progression
- [ ] Prerequisites from Parts 1-4 are clearly stated
- [ ] 3 chapters (25-27) scope is confirmed
- [ ] Advanced complexity tier rationale is clear
- [ ] Team collaboration and scaling are emphasized
- [ ] Real-world case study requirements are identified
- [ ] Forward connections to Parts 6+ (agents, deployment, databases) are explicit

## Notes & Issues

### Critical Issues (Block Proceeding)
- *(Add any critical issues discovered during validation)*

### Major Issues (Should Fix)
- *(Add any major issues that should be resolved before planning)*

### Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- *(Add any minor issues that can be addressed during planning or later)*
