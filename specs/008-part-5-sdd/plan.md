# Part 5: Spec-Kit Plus Methodology — Implementation Plan

**Branch**: `008-part-5-sdd` | **Date**: 2025-11-01 | **Spec**: `/specs/008-part-5-sdd/spec.md`

**Plan Status**: Complete — Ready for Task Generation & Lesson Writing

---

## Summary

Part 5 pivots students from technical skills (Parts 1-4) to professional software development methodology. Three interleaved chapters teach Specification-Driven Development (SDD) through progressive, hands-on projects:

- **Chapter 25** (Fundamentals): Concept-first + AI collaboration discovery — students learn *why* SDD matters
- **Chapter 26** (Hands-On): SpecifyPlus framework + mini-projects — students learn *how* to use SDD
- **Chapter 27** (Real-World): Capstone project + team simulation — students learn *when* to scale SDD

**Pedagogical Model**: Theory and practice run in parallel. Every concept introduced in one chapter is immediately practiced in the next. Students move from abstract understanding (Ch 25) → safe practice (Ch 26 calculator) → real-world application (Ch 27 capstone: grading system with parallel AI agents).

**Key Outcome**: Students complete Part 5 capable of writing specifications for any project, planning implementation with SpecifyPlus, and coordinating AI agents through clear specifications. They are ready for Parts 6+ (Agentic AI, Deployment, Databases).

## Factual Claims Requiring Verification

**Market Validation**:
- "Grading systems are YC-validated problem" — Verify: Gradewiz, Edexia, Frizzle, Mimir all exist and solving this problem
- Maintenance trigger: Annual review of startup status

**Rework Statistics**:
- "35-50% rework without specs vs. 15-20% with specs" — Source needed (academic research or industry survey)
- Maintenance trigger: Update when better data available

**Company Examples**:
- Stripe API specification enabling 15+ SDKs
- Anthropic Claude API documentation
- AWS 200+ teams coordinating via service contracts
- Maintenance trigger: Verify current accuracy before publication

**Tool Commands**:
- SpecifyPlus command syntax (`/sp.specify`, `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`)
- Maintenance trigger: Major SpecifyPlus version releases

---

## Architecture Decisions

**Decision 1: Interleaved vs. Sequential Chapters**
- **Selected**: Interleaved (theory + practice each chapter)
- **Rationale**: Maintains motivation; students practice immediately after learning
- **Alternative Rejected**: Sequential (all theory then all practice) = loss of engagement

**Decision 2: AI Companions for Chapter 27**
- **Selected**: Parallel instances (2 AI companions, 2 features)
- **Rationale**: Demonstrates real team coordination challenges; specs solve real problems
- **Alternative Rejected**: Single feature = misses team lessons

**Decision 3: Capstone Scope**
- **Selected**: Real grading system (market-validated problem)
- **Rationale**: Motivation + relevance to real students' lives (many have teacher connections)
- **Alternative Rejected**: Toy project (low motivation, low relevance)
