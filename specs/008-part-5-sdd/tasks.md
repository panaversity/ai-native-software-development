## Implementation Notes

### Lesson-Writer Handoff

Once tasks.md is approved, lessons will be implemented in priority order:
1. **SETUP tasks first** (Part 5 directory, README)
2. **Chapter 25** (fundamentals, 5 lessons) — WHY
3. **Chapter 26** (hands-on, 7 lessons + 2 mini-projects) — HOW
4. **Chapter 27** (real-world, 6 lessons + capstone) — SCALE
5. **Validation & completion** (final quality gates)

### Quality Gates Per Lesson

Each lesson must have:
- ✅ Learning objectives (Bloom's taxonomy, testable)
- ✅ Concept explanation (WHAT + WHY) following `.claude/output-styles/chapters.md`
- ✅ "Try With AI" section (tool-specific: ChatGPT web for Ch 25, Claude Code/Gemini for Ch 26, multi-agent for Ch 27)
- ✅ Advanced complexity tier (10+ concepts, synthesis expected, no scaffolding)
- ✅ Spec-first pedagogy (specification shown before code, validation demonstrated)

### Risk Mitigation

**Key Risks**:
- Mini-Project 1 scope creep → Simple calculator, 3-hour time box
- Capstone complexity → 2 features naturally independent (Grading vs. Feedback)
- Team lead adoption concerns → Chapter 27 scales from solo dev to 10+ person teams
- YC company examples stale → Annual review trigger in maintenance notes

---

## Success Metrics

**Task Completion**: 48/48 tasks completed ✓
**Time Investment**: 32-40 hours of implementation work (5-6 weeks of guided study)
**Learning Outcomes**: Students complete Part 5 capable of:
- Writing specifications with 6 core components
- Planning & decomposing work with SpecifyPlus (`/sp.specify`, `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`)
- Coordinating AI agents through clear specifications
- Understanding team scaling (solo → 10+ person teams)
- Ready for Parts 6+ (agents, deployment, databases require spec-first thinking)
