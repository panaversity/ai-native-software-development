# Feature Specification: Part 5 Introduction & Chapter Planning

**Feature Branch**: `008-part-5-sdd`
**Created**: 2025-11-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "build part 5 introduction - SpecKit Plus Methodology..."

## Overview

Part 5 ("Spec-Kit Plus Methodology", Chapters 25-27) pivots from technical skills (Parts 1-4) to professional software development workflow. While Parts 1-4 taught AI-native mindset, tools, prompting, and production Python, Part 5 teaches the **specification-driven development methodology** that ties everything together.

This specification covers:
1. **Part 5 Introduction document** — Pedagogical purpose, workflow overview, and real-world context
2. **Part 5 README.md** — Directory structure and learning progression
3. **Chapter Planning** — 3 chapters (25-27) with learning objectives, topics, and case studies
4. **Complexity Tier** — Advanced (Parts 6-8): Readers are proficient in Python; ready for architectural thinking and real-world workflows

**Key Insight**: Part 5 is "how to think like a specification-first developer." It teaches the SDD loop (Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implementation → Validation) as a methodology applicable to any project, tool, or team size.

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1: Developer Learning Spec-Driven Methodology (Priority: P1)

A student who completed Parts 1-4 learns the professional software development workflow using SpecKit Plus. They understand how specifications drive planning, how to write clear requirements, and how to validate AI-generated implementations.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value of Part 5. Without it, students remain tactical (code-first); with it, they become strategic (specification-first).

**Independent Test**: Can a developer who has completed Parts 1-4 read Part 5's introduction and chapters, then write a specification for a real project (e.g., "build a task tracking API") and break it into testable tasks without guidance?

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a completed Part 5, **When** a developer faces a new project, **Then** they instinctively write a specification before opening their editor.
2. **Given** Chapter 25 (SDD Fundamentals), **When** a developer reads the spec vs. code comparison, **Then** they understand why specifications reduce iteration cycles.
3. **Given** Chapter 26 (Writing Specifications), **When** a developer writes their first spec, **Then** they can identify missing requirements using the acceptance criteria checklist.
4. **Given** Chapter 27 (Real-World Workflows), **When** a developer sees a SpecKit case study, **Then** they see how the methodology scales from 1-person to 10-person teams.

---

### User Story 2: Team Lead Adopting SpecKit in Workflows (Priority: P1)

A technical lead or architect uses Part 5 to understand how to integrate SpecKit Plus into their team's development process. They learn how specifications improve collaboration, reduce miscommunication, and speed up implementation.

**Why this priority**: Team adoption is critical for real-world impact. Part 5 must speak to leadership concerns: quality, speed, team alignment.

**Independent Test**: Can a team lead read Part 5 and create a short implementation plan for integrating specification-driven development into their team's current workflow?

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Chapter 27 (Real-World Workflows), **When** a team lead reads the section on "Spec-Driven Teams", **Then** they see concrete practices: code review gates, specification templates, metrics.
2. **Given** Part 5's introduction, **When** a team lead asks "Will this slow us down?", **Then** the content directly addresses speed/quality tradeoffs.

---

### User Story 3: Content Creator Building on Part 5 (Priority: P2)

A course instructor or technical author uses Part 5 to teach specification-driven development in their own context. They need clear pedagogical patterns and adaptable examples.

**Why this priority**: Enables Part 5 to be repurposed beyond this book (e.g., corporate training, bootcamps).

**Independent Test**: Can an instructor take Part 5's chapters and teach the same concepts to a different audience (e.g., JavaScript developers, data engineers) with minimal adaptation?

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Chapter 25's pedagogical structure, **When** an instructor adapts it for TypeScript, **Then** the core SDD concepts remain language-agnostic.

---

### Edge Cases

- What if a developer has never used AI tools before? Part 5 assumes Parts 1-3 completed (AI literacy). How do we flag this dependency?
- What if a team is already using a different specification format (ADRs, RFC, design docs)? Part 5 should show interoperability, not rejection.
- How do Part 5 concepts connect to Parts 6+ (Agents, Deployment, Databases)? Chapter planning should flag forward links.

## Constraints & Non-Goals

### Constraints

- Part 5 MUST emphasize SDD as methodology, not tool or framework; SpecKit Plus is ONE implementation.
- Part 5 MUST show how SDD applies to teams of any size (1-person to 10+ person teams).
- All case studies MUST be real-world derived; hypothetical scenarios are supplementary only.
- Part 5 MUST maintain consistency with Parts 1-4 (specification-first workflow, validation-first safety).

### Non-Goals

- **NOT**: Writing actual lesson content (that's phase 2, lesson-writer subagent).
- **NOT**: Building SpecKit tools or scripts (those are separate features).
- **NOT**: Teaching other methodologies (agile, waterfall, etc.) beyond brief context.
- **NOT**: Covering organizational change management beyond "integrating SDD into your workflow."

---

## Complexity Tier: Advanced (Parts 6-8)

**Applied for Part 5**:

- **Cognitive Load**: 5+ new concepts per lesson section; synthesis and architectural thinking expected.
- **Student Responsibility**: Apply SDD to real projects; think about tradeoffs and scaling.
- **Case Studies**: Substantial real-world examples showing methodology in practice.
- **Scaffolding Approach**: "Here's the principle; here's how it scales; here's how it connects to your work."
- **Framing**: "You have Python skills and AI literacy; now think strategically about software development."

---

## Part 5 Specific Scope

**3 Chapters (25-27) with AI Co-Learning Collaboration Model**:

### **Chapter 25: Specification-Driven Development Fundamentals**

**Pedagogical Model:** Concept-first + AI collaboration discovery

**Topics**:
- What is SDD? Why does it matter for AI-native development?
- The SDD loop: Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implementation → Validation
- Spec vs. code: costs, benefits, when to use each
- Connection to Parts 6+ (agents need clear specs, deployment needs specs, etc.)

**AI Collaboration Pattern:**
- Students understand foundational concepts first (SDD loop, benefits, costs)
- **Spec-First Discovery**: Student writes a rough spec → AI companion generates example implementations → They compare outputs (spec-driven vs. code-first) → Discuss tradeoffs → Refine spec together
- Students see concrete value: vague specs → AI struggles; clear specs → AI excels

**Learning Outcomes**: Students understand *why* SDD matters and can articulate the cost/benefit tradeoff for different project types

---

### **Chapter 26: Writing and Planning Specifications with SpecifyPlus**

**Pedagogical Model:** Hands-on with SpecifyPlus framework + progressive project complexity

**Topics**:
- Spec structure: user stories, requirements, acceptance criteria
- Writing testable requirements
- SpecifyPlus tools and framework (commands: `/sp.specify`, `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`, etc.)
- Planning tools and templates from SpecifyPlus
- Hands-on: How to use `uvx specifyplus init <projectname>` and select AI companions (Gemini CLI, Claude Code, etc.)

**AI Collaboration Pattern - Progressive Projects**:

1. **Mini-Project 1: Simple Python Calculator**
   - Student sets up SpecifyPlus: `uvx specifyplus init calculator`
   - Selects AI companion (Claude Code or Gemini CLI) and shell (bash or PowerShell)
   - Works with AI to: write spec → execute `/sp.plan` → execute `/sp.tasks` → implement → validate
   - **Purpose**: Learn the complete SDD loop in a safe, bounded project
   - **Outcome**: Students are now fluent in SpecifyPlus commands and workflow

2. **Mini-Project 2: Start Planning Real Project**
   - Introduce the capstone project: "Assignments Grading and Feedback Agentic System"
   - Student (with AI companion guidance) begins writing initial spec for grading system
   - **Purpose**: Apply SpecifyPlus and SDD concepts to real-world problem
   - **Outcome**: Students understand how to approach complex systems with specs

**Learning Outcomes**: Students can fluently use SpecifyPlus tools, understand core commands (`/sp.specify`, `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`), and apply them to real projects

---

### **Chapter 27: Real-World Spec-Kit Workflows & Team Collaboration**

**Pedagogical Model:** Full capstone project with multi-agent team simulation

**Topics**:
- Team case studies: 1-person, 5-person, 10+ person teams using SDD
- Integration with existing processes (GitHub, Jira, etc.)
- Spec-driven code review and async collaboration
- Scaling from MVP to production
- Q&A: "Will this slow us down?" "How do we adopt this?" "What about distributed teams?"

**AI Collaboration Pattern - Capstone Project**:

**Live Project: Assignments Grading and Feedback Agentic System**

Real-world context (YC-validated market):
- Proven startups solving this problem (Gradewiz, Edexia, Frizzle, Mimir)
- Teachers desperately need this solution
- Students are building something that *matters*

**Execution**:
- Student sets up 2 SpecifyPlus project instances (representing two teams)
- 2 AI companion instances working *in parallel* on different features
- **Feature 1 (AI Companion A)**: Grading engine and rubric matching
- **Feature 2 (AI Companion B)**: Feedback generation and personalization
- Students experience real parallel development challenges:
  - How specs enable async collaboration between teams
  - How to coordinate features that depend on each other
  - How to validate that independent specs compose into a cohesive system

**Progression**:
1. Student writes master spec for grading system (using SpecifyPlus framework)
2. Breaks spec into 2 feature specs (using `/sp.plan`)
3. Creates 2 project instances, each with own AI companion
4. Watches AI companions work in parallel on different features
5. Validates outputs, identifies gaps, refines specs
6. Learns how specifications enable teams to work independently yet coherently

**Learning Outcomes**:
- Students understand how SDD scales from 1-person solo developer (Ch 26) → teams (Ch 27)
- Can coordinate multiple AI agents through clear specifications
- Understand why specs matter for team velocity and quality
- Are ready for Parts 6+ (agentic AI, deployment, scaling)
