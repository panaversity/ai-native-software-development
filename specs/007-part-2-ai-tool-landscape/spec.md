# Feature Specification: Part 2 - AI Tool Landscape

**Feature Branch**: `007-part-2-ai-tool-landscape`
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: In Review
**Input**: User description: "Plan part-2 for our book covering AI Tool Landscape with 4 chapters on Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Bash, and Git."

---

## Part 2 Overview

**Purpose**: Part 2 introduces learners to the practical AI development tools and fundamental CLI/version control skills required for AI-driven development. It bridges the conceptual foundation from Part 1 to the hands-on development skills needed in Parts 3-7.

**Target Audience**: Developers new to AI-assisted coding who have completed Part 1 (or understand core AI concepts). Assumes basic computer literacy but no prior experience with CLI tools, Git, or AI development platforms.

**Book Context**:
- **Part 1 (Chapters 1-4)**: Foundation—AI transformation, opportunities, challenges, and mindset
- **Part 2 (Chapters 5-8)**: Tool literacy—Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Bash, Git (THIS SPEC)
- **Part 3+**: Python fundamentals and advanced programming with AI assistance

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1: New Developer Gets Started with Claude Code (Priority: P1)

**Scenario**: A developer completing Part 1 wants to immediately put AI tools into practice. They need to understand what Claude Code is, how to install it, and how to execute their first AI-assisted task.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary hook. If learners can't get Claude Code working and experience immediate value, they abandon the book. Claude Code is featured first and is the most fully-featured AI development platform covered.

**Independent Test**: Reader completes Claude Code installation, creates a simple test project, and executes one subagent task. Delivers concrete value: "I used an AI tool to write code autonomously."

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a reader has finished Part 1, **When** they follow Chapter 5 instructions, **Then** Claude Code is installed and working
2. **Given** Claude Code is installed, **When** they follow the Quick Start example, **Then** they generate working code with subagents
3. **Given** a working Claude Code installation, **When** they enable Skills, **Then** they understand custom skill creation for domain advantage

---

### User Story 2: Developer Understands Gemini CLI as Open Alternative (Priority: P1)

**Scenario**: A developer learns that Gemini CLI is free, open-source, and extensible. They want to understand its unique value proposition, how it differs from Claude Code, and when to use it.

**Why this priority**: Principle 11 (Tool Diversity) requires honest comparison. Gemini CLI's free tier and open-source nature make it critical for accessible learning and for developers with budget constraints. Extensions (similar to Claude Code Skills) create competitive advantage.

**Independent Test**: Reader installs Gemini CLI, authenticates with Google account, executes a command, and understands its strengths vs. Claude Code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a reader has Part 1 foundation, **When** they read Chapter 6, **Then** they understand Gemini CLI's free tier and rate limits
2. **Given** Gemini CLI installed, **When** they authenticate and execute a CLI command, **Then** it works and they see extension capabilities
3. **Given** understanding of both tools, **When** they review the comparison, **Then** they can articulate when to use each tool

---

### User Story 3: Developer Becomes Productive with Bash for AI Development (Priority: P1)

**Scenario**: A developer realizes they need to be comfortable with command-line tools to work effectively with Claude Code and Gemini CLI. They need practical Bash knowledge focused on AI development workflows, not comprehensive system administration.

**Why this priority**: Bash literacy is prerequisite for using AI tools effectively. Many readers will have never used CLI before. Part 2 must establish this foundation early. Focus is laser-targeted: navigation, file operations, package management, environment variables, and AI-specific patterns.

**Independent Test**: Reader completes 3-5 Bash commands independently (navigate directories, create files, manage environment variables) and uses AI tools to execute others confidently.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** no prior CLI experience, **When** they complete Chapter 7 Part I, **Then** they can navigate directories, list files, and create projects
2. **Given** basic Bash knowledge, **When** they use natural language prompts in Chapter 7 Part II, **Then** they can request AI tools to execute Bash commands
3. **Given** Chapter 7 completion, **When** they set up API keys and environment variables, **Then** Claude Code and Gemini CLI work correctly

---

### User Story 4: Developer Understands Git & GitHub for AI-Driven Safety (Priority: P1)

**Scenario**: A developer learns that version control is CRITICAL when working with AI tools—you need checkpoints to undo AI mistakes, safe branches to experiment, and PRs to review AI-generated code before merging. Git becomes a safety net and portfolio tool.

**Why this priority**: This is non-negotiable safety training. When learners let AI tools modify code, they must have Git discipline. PRs enable code review culture. GitHub becomes portfolio for job seekers. This establishes professional workflows from the start.

**Independent Test**: Reader creates a local Git repository, makes commits, creates branches, opens a pull request, and can explain how to safely experiment with AI-generated code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** no prior Git experience, **When** they complete Chapter 8 Part I, **Then** they can initialize repos, commit, push, and create branches
2. **Given** basic Git knowledge, **When** they practice the AI safety workflows, **Then** they create checkpoint commits before AI changes and can rollback if needed
3. **Given** Git basics mastered, **When** they open a PR, **Then** they document what AI generated and can request review from teammates

## Assumptions & Design Decisions

**Assumption 1: Readers Have Completed Part 1**
- We assume foundational AI literacy (what AI is, key opportunities/challenges, AI-driven mindset)
- We don't re-explain concepts from Part 1
- Part 2 jumps immediately into tool installation and practice

**Assumption 2: Minimal Bash/Git Prior Knowledge**
- Many readers will have NEVER used command line before
- We design for absolute beginners while accommodating some prior experience
- We emphasize that learners don't need to memorize Bash—AI tools help them
- Two-part structure (commands + natural language prompts) caters to different learning styles

**Assumption 3: Tool Versions Will Change**
- Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Bash all update regularly
- We capture current state (as of 2025-10-30) but include maintenance notes
- Links are verified at publication; quarterly updates required
- Tool sections include "check these official docs for current version"

**Assumption 4: Diverse Platform Backgrounds**
- Readers use Windows, Mac, or Linux
- We provide platform-specific instructions (package managers differ significantly)
- We test code examples on all three platforms before publication
- Troubleshooting sections address platform-specific issues

**Assumption 5: Safety Is Non-Negotiable**
- When learners use AI tools to modify code, they MUST have Git discipline
- We treat checkpoints, branches, and PRs as professional safety practices
- We model this behavior: "Always commit before letting AI make changes"
- We don't position this as optional or advanced—it's fundamental
