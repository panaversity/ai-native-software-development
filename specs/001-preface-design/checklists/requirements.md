# Specification Quality Checklist: Design and Write Book Preface

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Feature**: [001-preface-design/spec.md](../spec.md)
**Status**: Ready for Review

---

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) in scope description
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs (reader understanding, book promise)
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders (educators, founders, students)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions)

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (specification is clear and actionable)
- [x] Functional Requirements are testable and unambiguous (21 FRs covering content, tone, alignment, pedagogy)
- [x] Success Criteria are measurable (8 SCs with specific targets: 85% sentiment, 80% completion, etc.)
- [x] Success Criteria are technology-agnostic (focused on reader outcomes, not implementation)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined (4 user stories with Given-When-Then scenarios)
- [x] Edge cases identified (non-English readers, skipped preface, overwhelmed by frameworks, print/digital)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (4,500–6,000 words, 9 major sections, no implementation code)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (7 clear assumptions about accessibility, specification-first, etc.)

---

## Specification Clarity

- [x] User personas are distinct and well-characterized (Student, Developer, Educator, Founder)
- [x] User Stories follow priority structure (2 P1, 1 P2, 1 P3 reflecting importance)
- [x] Each User Story includes independent test scenario (testable MVP)
- [x] Key Entities clearly defined (Audience Personas, Core Concepts, Book Promise)
- [x] Constraints are realistic and well-justified (length, no code, print/digital)
- [x] Out-of-Scope items are clearly stated (tutorials, AI theory, case studies, etc.)

---

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria (FRs map to measurable outcomes)
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (complete reader journey through preface sections)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (comprehension, audience diversity, completion rates)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification (Preface content is described as *what* not *how*)

---

## Constitutional Alignment

- [x] Specification references book constitution (v3.0.0)
- [x] Alignment with core principles stated explicitly (Principles #6, #12, #14, #17)
- [x] Domain skills identified (Learning Objectives, Concept Scaffolding, Book Scaffolding, Technical Clarity, AI-Collaborate Teaching)
- [x] Pedagogical intent is clear (teach thinking before coding, emphasize validation, establish co-learning)

## Questions for Approval Checklist

Before proceeding to `/sp.plan`, confirm answers to:

- [ ] Is the Preface scope appropriate (4,500–6,000 words, 9 major sections)?
- [ ] Are the four audience personas correctly identified and prioritized?
- [ ] Should the 5-level maturity model be simplified or kept full?
- [ ] Is specification-first sufficiently emphasized without overwhelming readers?
- [ ] Should the Preface include visuals (diagrams, tables) or remain prose-only?

## Validation Summary

**Overall Assessment**: SPECIFICATION IS COMPLETE AND READY FOR PLANNING

This specification clearly defines:
- **What** the Preface must accomplish (21 Functional Requirements)
- **Who** it serves (4 distinct audience personas)
- **How success is measured** (8 concrete Success Criteria)
- **Why it matters** (Constitutional alignment, pedagogical grounding)

The specification avoids implementation details while providing enough clarity for planning and content creation. It balances accessibility for beginners with intellectual rigor for experienced professionals.

**Next Step**: Proceed to `/sp.plan` to create detailed outline, section breakdown, and content plan.

## Notes for Planner

When moving to the planning phase, ensure:

1. **Outline Structure**: Create section-by-section outline mapping each FR to specific content.
2. **Domain Skills Mapping**: Assign pedagogical skills to each section (learning objectives, scaffolding, clarity, etc.).
3. **Content Sequencing**: Build from hook → accessibility reassurance → spectrum understanding → maturity levels → dual languages → spec-driven way → co-learning philosophy → learning outcomes → audience fit.
4. **Tone Calibration**: Each section must balance beginner accessibility with expert depth.
5. **Validation Strategy**: Plan how each FR will be validated in the final Preface content.
