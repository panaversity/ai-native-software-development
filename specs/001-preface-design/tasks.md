## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Foundation)**: No dependencies - can start immediately after spec/plan approval
- **Phase 2 (Context)**: Depends on Phase 1 completion (builds on foundation sections)
- **Phase 3 (Philosophy)**: Depends on Phases 1-2 completion (philosophy built on methodology and context)
- **Phase 4 (Closure)**: Depends on Phases 1-3 completion (outcomes and audience positioning require core content complete)
- **Phase 5 (Integration)**: Depends on all writing phases (Phases 1-4) complete

### Section Writing Order

**Recommended sequence**:
1. Section 1 (Hook) → Section 2 (Why) → Section 5 (Spec-Driven Way) [Phase 1]
2. Section 3 (Spectrum) → Section 4 (Dual Language) [Phase 2]
3. Section 6 (Co-Learning) → Section 7 (AI-Native Thinking) [Phase 3]
4. Section 8 (Learning Outcomes) → Section 9 (Audiences) → Section 10 (How to Use) [Phase 4]

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Phases**:
- Phase 1: T002 (S1 review) and T003 (S2 writing) can overlap
- Phase 1: T004 (S2 review) and T005 (S5 writing) can overlap
- Phase 2: All writing tasks (T008-T011) can be parallelized if multiple writers
- Phase 2: T013 (visuals) and T015 (S4 writing) can run in parallel
- Phase 3: T018 (S6 writing) and T020-T023 (S7 subsections) can overlap if multiple writers
- Phase 4: T029-T032 (S9 subsections for 4 personas) can be fully parallelized
- Phase 5: T038-T040 (validation tasks) can run in parallel

**Review Tasks**: All review tasks marked [P] can run independently and in parallel with next section's writing

### Critical Path

**Sequential (cannot be parallelized)**:
1. T001 → T003 → T005 (foundation sections must be written in order)
2. T007 (integration requires all Phase 1 sections complete)
3. T017 (integration requires Phase 2 complete)
4. T026 (integration requires Phase 3 complete)
5. T037 (full integration requires all sections complete)
6. T042 → T043 (beta feedback must precede revision)
7. T045 → T046 (publication tasks sequential)

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Foundation + Context)

**Minimum viable Preface for internal feedback**:
1. Complete Phase 1 (Sections 1, 2, 5) - Foundation established
2. Complete Phase 2 (Sections 3, 4) - Context provided
3. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Internal team review of Sections 1-5
4. Gather feedback on tone, accessibility, clarity
5. Refine before proceeding to philosophy sections

**Value**: Early validation prevents major rework; ensures foundation solid before building philosophy

---

### Incremental Delivery

**Staged approach**:
1. Complete Phase 1 → Internal review → Refine
2. Complete Phase 2 → Internal review → Refine
3. Complete Phase 3 → Internal review → Refine
4. Complete Phase 4 → Internal review → Refine
5. Phase 5 integration → Beta review → Final revision → Publication

**Value**: Continuous feedback loop; early course correction; stakeholder visibility

---

### Parallel Writing Strategy

**With multiple content writers**:

**Writer A**: Sections 1, 2, 5 (Foundation) → Sections 6, 7 (Philosophy)
**Writer B**: Sections 3, 4 (Context) → Sections 8, 10 (Outcomes + How to Use)
**Writer C**: Section 9 (Audiences - 4 subsections)
**Lead**: Integration tasks (T007, T017, T026, T037) + all validation tasks

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks with parallel team vs. 4-6 weeks solo

- [ ] FR-010: Accessible, conversational language for non-technical + rigorous for experts
- [ ] FR-011: No unexplained jargon; all necessary terms defined
- [ ] FR-012: Compelling metaphors and analogies used effectively
- [ ] FR-013: Optimism balanced with intellectual honesty about limitations

**Alignment & Grounding** (FR-014 to FR-017):
- [ ] FR-014: Grounded in Constitution v3.0.0 (Principles #6, #12, #14, #17)
- [ ] FR-015: Book URLs referenced (ai-native.panaversity.org, panaversity.com/books/...)
- [ ] FR-016: No specific tool recommendations (tools saved for chapters)
- [ ] FR-017: No programming knowledge assumed; experts acknowledged

**Pedagogical Intent** (FR-018 to FR-021):
- [ ] FR-018: Learning AI-native development positioned as fundamentally different
- [ ] FR-019: Validation, critical thinking, evaluation reinforced as core skills
- [ ] FR-020: Clear expectation: teaches *thinking* like AI-native dev, not just *coding*
- [ ] FR-021: Specification-first development clearly non-negotiable

### Success Criteria (8 SCs)

- [ ] SC-001: Non-technical reader can explain AI-native development in plain language
- [ ] SC-002: Experienced developer can distinguish 3 approaches, map org to maturity level, articulate Python + TypeScript necessity
- [ ] SC-003: 85%+ positive sentiment from all audience types in feedback
- [ ] SC-004: 80%+ readers complete Preface (measured via analytics if available)
- [ ] SC-005: 80%+ educators report pedagogical framework alignment
- [ ] SC-006: 75%+ readers begin Chapter 1 within 1 week of reading Preface
- [ ] SC-007: Zero confusion reports about book's scope, audience, or methodology
- [ ] SC-008: 80%+ early readers express enthusiasm for co-learning approach

### Constitutional Alignment

- [ ] Principle #6 (Specification-First Methodology): Preface establishes spec-first as foundational
- [ ] Principle #12 (Accessibility for Non-Programmers): Preface explicitly welcomes beginners
- [ ] Principle #14 (Bilingual Development): Preface positions Python + TypeScript as co-equal
- [ ] Principle #17 (Co-Learning as Core Practice): Preface defines and illustrates co-learning loop

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Beginner Overwhelm (5 Maturity Levels)
**Mitigation Tasks**: T008 (clear outline), T012 (concrete examples), T013 (visual aids)
**Validation**: SC-001 (non-technical comprehension)

### Risk 2: Expert Underwhelm (Not Technical Enough)
**Mitigation Tasks**: T009-T011 (AI Spectrum depth), T020-T023 (professional thinking)
**Validation**: SC-002 (developer framework mastery)

### Risk 3: Length Overrun (Target 4,500-6,000 words)
**Mitigation**: Strict word budgets per section; Phase 5 editing pass (T044)
**Current target**: 5,400-6,400 words (within 10-15% buffer)

### Risk 4: Tone Inconsistency
**Mitigation**: Regular integration tasks (T007, T017, T026, T037); final polish (T044)
**Validation**: FR-010 review in all review tasks

### Risk 5: Persona Exclusion
**Mitigation**: Explicit subsections for all 4 personas (T029-T032); shared conclusion (T033)
**Validation**: SC-003 (85%+ positive sentiment ALL audiences)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = can run in parallel (independent sections or review tasks)
- [SectionN] = maps to specific Preface section (S1-S10)
- [US] = serves specific user story persona (US1=Student, US2=Developer, US3=Educator, US4=Founder)
- Word budgets are targets, not hard limits (±10% acceptable)
- Commit after each section draft and after each review pass
- Stop at each Phase checkpoint to validate before proceeding
- Beta review (T042) requires coordination with real readers from all 4 personas
- Constitution v3.0.0 is source of truth for all alignment decisions
