## Overview

This task checklist decomposes the CONSOLIDATED lesson plan (5 lessons instead of 8) into concrete, implementable tasks for the lesson-writer subagent. Each task is atomic (1-3 hours), testable, and has clear acceptance criteria.

**Key Changes from 8-Lesson to 5-Lesson Structure**:
- Consolidated Lessons 1-2 → New Lesson 1 (10-12 min)
- Consolidated Lessons 3-4 → New Lesson 2 (12-14 min)
- Kept Lesson 5 with minor consolidation → New Lesson 3 (8-9 min)
- Kept Lesson 6 with minor consolidation → New Lesson 4 (9-10 min)
- Consolidated Lessons 7-8 → New Lesson 5 (10-12 min)

**Task Categories**:
1. **Content Writing** (5 lesson writing tasks, not 8)
2. **Visual Assets** (7 diagrams, redistributed)
3. **Exercises & Assessments** (same scope, fewer lessons to manage)
4. **Media Integration** (same videos + PDFs, different lesson placement)
5. **Review & Validation** (same rigor, updated checklist for 5 lessons)

## Dependencies & Sequencing

**Phase 1 (Content) dependencies**:
- Lessons 1-2 are foundational; others depend on them
- Lesson 3 depends on Lesson 2
- Lesson 4 depends on Lessons 1-3
- Lesson 5 depends on Lessons 1-4 (synthesizes all)

**Phase 2 (Visuals) can proceed in parallel with Phase 1**:
- All diagram tasks are independent of each other
- But diagram publication depends on lessons being ready for embedding

**Phase 3 (Assessments) can proceed in parallel with Phases 1-2**:
- Reflection prompts (Task 2.2) depend on lessons being drafted
- Quiz (Task 2.3) can proceed once lessons drafted
- Worksheet (Task 2.1) critical for Lesson 5

**Phase 4 (Media) can proceed in parallel after Phase 1 drafts**:
- Embedding videos (Tasks 4.1-4.2) depends on lessons being ready
- PDF references (Tasks 4.3-4.4) can proceed independently

**Phase 5 (Review) must occur after all Phases 1-4**:
- Reviews need final content to assess
- Reviews are quality gates before publication

**Recommended execution order**:
1. **Week 1**: Tasks 1.1-1.5 (all lesson writing) + Tasks 2.1-2.7 (diagrams) in parallel
2. **Week 2**: Tasks 3.1-3.4 (assessments), Tasks 3.1-3.4 (media integration)
3. **Week 3**: Tasks 5.1-5.6 (all reviews and testing)
4. **Week 4**: Final refinements, sign-off (Task 2.1), handoff to publication

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Lessons become too technical (overwhelm beginners) | Medium | High | Task 2.2 accessibility review; use analogies heavily; keep vocab Grade 10-12 |
| Diagrams confuse rather than clarify | Medium | Medium | Get non-author feedback before finalizing; simplify until 5-7 major elements max |
| PPP strategy too abstract for beginners | Medium | Medium | Real finance example in Task 2.6; worksheet grounds it concretely |
| Readers don't understand prerequisite chains | Low | Medium | Lesson 5 worksheet requires understanding prior lessons; quiz tests this |
| Videos/PDFs become unavailable/broken | Low | Medium | Task 5.6 checks all links; provide fallback descriptions |
| Tone becomes hype-y not motivational | Medium | Medium | Constitutional review (Task 2.3) catches this; include realistic caveats in each lesson |
| 5-lesson consolidation feels rushed or dense | Medium | High | Monitor reading times carefully; add more visuals/examples if density high; use analogies liberally |
| Consolidation loses important concepts | Low | High | Lesson mapping verified (no missing concepts); all 10 core concepts from spec included |

## Next Steps After Tasks Complete

Once all tasks approved and complete:

1. **Technical-Reviewer Sign-Off**: Task 2.1 confirms all ready
2. **Handoff to Publication**: Chapter 3 content committed to book-source/docs/
3. **Part 1 Completion**: Once Chapters 1-3 complete, Part 1 finalized
4. **Docusaurus Deployment**: Chapter 3 deployed to live book site
5. **Feedback Loop**: Monitor user feedback on Chapter 3 (worksheet submissions, quiz results)
6. **Iteration**: Address issues if any found in live version

**END OF CONSOLIDATED TASK CHECKLIST**

## Summary of Consolidation (8 Lessons → 5 Lessons)

**Original Structure** → **Consolidated Structure**:
- Original Lessons 1-2 → New Lesson 1 (10-12 min)
- Original Lessons 3-4 → New Lesson 2 (12-14 min)
- Original Lesson 5 → New Lesson 3 (8-9 min, unchanged)
- Original Lesson 6 → New Lesson 4 (9-10 min, unchanged)
- Original Lessons 7-8 → New Lesson 5 (10-12 min)

**Key Changes**:
- Same total reading time (30-45 min) but denser per lesson
- Same 7 diagrams, redistributed across 5 lessons
- Same core concepts (10) all preserved
- Same assessments (quiz, worksheet, exercises) with 5 lessons to manage (not 8)
- Tasks reduced from ~30 to ~25 writing tasks (3 diagrams per visual task now instead of 1 each)
- Effort reduced from 60-80 hours to 45-60 hours
- Same learning objectives (LO-001 through LO-004) still met
- Same success criteria (SC-001 through SC-010) still met
