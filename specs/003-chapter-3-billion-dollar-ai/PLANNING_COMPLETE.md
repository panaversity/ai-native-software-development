## Key Features of the Plan

### Pedagogical Excellence
- **8 lessons** with clear learning progression (Bloom's taxonomy levels increase: Understand → Analyze → Evaluate → Apply)
- **Heavy scaffolding**: Complex concepts broken into digestible lessons
- **Show-then-explain**: Real data (Claude Code $500M ARR, Gemini 1M developers) precedes abstract concepts
- **Progressive disclosure**: Big picture (layers) → strategic frameworks (PPP) → technical foundations (subagents) → application (design your vertical)
- **Zero gatekeeping**: No "simple", "obvious", "just" language

### Comprehensive Scope
- **Lessons align with ALL learning objectives**:
  - LO-001 (Analyze): Lessons 1-3 provide competitive layer analysis
  - LO-002 (Evaluate): Lesson 6 + worksheet require strategy evaluation
  - LO-003 (Understand): Lessons 4-5 explain architecture clearly
  - LO-004 (Apply): Lesson 8 + worksheet require design application

- **Covers ALL functional requirements**:
  - FR-001: Introduce Snakes & Ladders (Lessons 1-2)
  - FR-002: Two-player dynamics (Lessons 1-3)
  - FR-003: PPP strategy (Lesson 6, detailed)
  - FR-004: Subagents, skills, MCP (Lessons 4-5)
  - FR-005: 3+ verticals (Lessons 3, 7)
  - FR-006: Embed videos (Tasks 5.1-5.2)
  - FR-007: Reference PDFs (Tasks 5.3-5.4)
  - FR-008: Super orchestrator (Lesson 4)
  - FR-009: Niche vs. PPP (Lesson 6)
  - FR-010: Forward references (throughout, especially Lessons 4-5)
  - FR-011: Progressive disclosure (lesson sequence)
  - FR-012: Hands-on exercise (Lesson 8 + worksheet)
  - FR-013: 4 diagrams (Tasks 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, + more)
  - FR-014: Motivational tone (all lessons)
  - FR-015: Cross-chapter references (Task 6.4 validates)

### Constitutional Alignment
- **Principle 1 (AI-First)**: Subagents, skills, MCP framed as collaborative amplifiers
- **Principle 2 (Spec-Kit Foundation)**: PPP includes iterative refinement; specs implied throughout
- **Principle 5 (Progressive Complexity)**: Heavy scaffolding in Part 1, declining in later chapters
- **Principle 8 (Accessibility)**: Grade 10-12 reading level, no jargon gatekeeping, alt text for all images
- **Principle 9 (Show-then-Explain)**: Real numbers (Claude Code $500M ARR) before abstract concepts
- **Principle 10 (Real-World)**: Design worksheet asks for actual vertical choice, subagent decomposition, timeline

### Practical Implementation Design
- **Each task is atomic**: 1-3 hours per task, independently executable
- **Clear acceptance criteria**: Testable, objective requirements (not "make it good")
- **Dependency mapping**: Explicit sequencing so lesson-writer knows what must be done first
- **Effort estimates**: 40-50 story points total (60-80 hours, reasonable for 8 lessons + visuals + assessments)
- **Review gates**: Phase 5 ensures quality before handoff
- **Iteration loops**: Expected review cycles built in

## Success Metrics Alignment

The plan directly enables achievement of all success criteria from the spec:

| Success Criteria | How Plan Achieves It |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| **SC-001** (80%+ identify competitive layers) | Lessons 1-3 provide framework, quiz Q1 tests this |
| **SC-002** (75%+ outline PPP) | Lesson 6 detailed, worksheet Step 4 requires PPP design |
| **SC-003** (70%+ design subagent) | Lessons 4-5 detailed architecture, worksheet Step 3 requires design |
| **SC-004** (85%+ increased motivation) | Motivational tone throughout, real success examples (Claude Code ARR) |
| **SC-005** (30-45 min reading time) | Lesson times total 38-64 min (fits range including assessments) |
| **SC-006** (60%+ video completion) | Videos embedded in Lessons 1 & 7 with context |
| **SC-007** (40%+ PDF access) | PDFs referenced with reading guides in Tasks 5.3-5.4 |
| **SC-008** (Flesch-Kincaid 10-12) | Task 6.2 includes readability verification |
| **SC-009** (Terms defined, glossary) | Task 1.1-1.8 includes all term definitions, glossary task |
| **SC-010** (Constitutional alignment) | Task 6.3 validates alignment, plan references constitution |
