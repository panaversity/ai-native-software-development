# Implementation Plan: Book Structure and Architect Plan

**Branch**: `002-book-structure` | **Date**: 2025-10-29 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-book-structure/spec.md`

**Note**: This is the architectural plan for establishing the complete book structure, directory organization, and Docusaurus configuration for "CoLearning Python & Agentic AI: The AI-Driven Way."

## Summary

Establish the complete book structure (32 chapters across 7 parts) with:
1. Directory organization aligned with Docusaurus requirements
2. Part-based folder hierarchy in `book-source/docs/`
3. Chapter templates and metadata for all 32 chapters
4. Docusaurus configuration for navigation and sidebar
5. Preview structure for reference and quality validation
6. Clear path for writers to understand where each chapter goes

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown (content) + YAML (frontmatter) + Python 3.13+ (code examples)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus v3.x (build/hosting), Python 3.13+ (for code examples in chapters)
**Storage**: File-based (Markdown files in `book-source/docs/[part]/[chapter].md`)
**Testing**: Docusaurus build validation, Markdown linting, code example validation (via pytest in chapter examples)
**Target Platform**: Web-based technical book (rendered by Docusaurus)
**Project Type**: Technical documentation/educational content (32-chapter book with code examples)
**Performance Goals**: Docusaurus build completes in <60 seconds, site renders instantly (static HTML)
**Constraints**:
- All 32 chapters must follow consistent Markdown structure (per `.claude/output-styles/chapters.md`)
- All code examples must use Python 3.13+ with type hints (per Constitution Principle 3)
- Chapter filenames must match chapter index exactly
- Directory structure must match Docusaurus expectations
**Scale/Scope**: 32 chapters, 7 parts, ~600-800 KB total content, ~200+ code examples

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- ✅ **code-example-generator** → All examples follow standard (types, docstrings, tests)
- ✅ **exercise-designer** → All chapters include exercises aligned to objectives
- ✅ **assessment-builder** → Quizzes and reviews per chapter
- ✅ **technical-clarity** → Output styles enforce clarity; no gatekeeping
- ✅ **book-architecture** → 7-part structure validated for pedagogical flow
- ✅ **ai-augmented-teaching** → Every chapter demonstrates learning WITH AI

### Non-Negotiable Rules ✅

**ALWAYS DO** (All implemented in output styles):
- ✅ Use type hints on every function (Constitution IV)
- ✅ Test all code before publication (Constitution IV)
- ✅ Explain WHY, not just HOW (Constitution IV)
- ✅ Provide working code examples (Constitution IV)
- ✅ Use Python 3.13+ modern syntax (Constitution IV)
- ✅ Include "Common Mistakes" section in every chapter (Constitution IV)
- ✅ Include "AI Exercise" starting Ch 3 (Constitution IV)

**NEVER DO** (All prevented by output styles + review gates):
- ❌ Vague gatekeeping language ("easy", "simple") (Constitution IV)
- ❌ Untested or broken code (Constitution IV)
- ❌ Assume reader knowledge (Constitution IV)
- ❌ Use deprecated Python syntax (Constitution IV)
- ❌ Skip type hints for "simple" functions (Constitution IV)
- ❌ Hardcode secrets, tokens, API keys (Constitution IV)

**GATE STATUS**: ✅ **ALL PASS** - Plan aligns with Constitution v2.0.0

- Clarify [PLACEHOLDER] items
- Output: `specs/part-X/part-X-spec.md`

**Phase 2: PLAN** (chapter-planner subagent)
- For each chapter: Create detailed lesson breakdown
- Output: `specs/part-X/chapter-Y-plan.md` + `chapter-Y-tasks.md`

**Phase 3: IMPLEMENT** (lesson-writer subagent, iterative)
- For each lesson: Write content and get approval
- Output: `docs/part-X/chapter-Y.mdx`

**Phase 4: VALIDATE** (technical-reviewer subagent)
- Test all code, verify pedagogy, check Constitution alignment
- Output: Validation report

    └── examples/                                         # Runnable code examples per chapter
```

**Structure Rationale**:
- ✅ **Part-based folders** match Docusaurus nav hierarchy
- ✅ **Chapter numbers** (01-, 02-, etc.) ensure correct ordering
- ✅ **Descriptive names** make chapters self-explanatory
- ✅ **Flat chapter structure** prevents nesting > 2 levels (Docusaurus best practice)
- ✅ **Matches chapter-index.md** exactly (single source of truth)
- ✅ **Supports multiple reading paths** (sidebar can reorder without file moves)

**Structure Decision**:
- **Documentation**: Stored in feature spec directory (`specs/002-book-structure/`)
- **Content**: Organized in `book-source/docs/` by Part (7 folders) → Chapter files (32 total)
- **Configuration**: Docusaurus config in `book-source/` root
- **Examples**: Runnable code stored in `book-source/static/examples/` (keyed by chapter)

## Phase 0: Research & Clarification

**Status**: No NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers in technical context.

**Key Decisions Already Made**:
- ✅ Docusaurus v3.x for static site generation (standard for technical books)
- ✅ Markdown + YAML frontmatter for content (industry standard)
- ✅ Python 3.13+ for all code examples (Constitution Principle 3)
- ✅ Part-based folder hierarchy (pedagogically aligned with 7-part structure)
- ✅ Chapter filenames match chapter-index.md (single source of truth)

**No research phase required**: Technical choices are locked by Constitution and specification.

---

## Phase 1: Design & Implementation

### 1.1 Data Model (`data-model.md`)

**Core Entities**:
- **Chapter**: Markdown file with YAML frontmatter, content, code examples
  - Fields: title, number, part, learning_objectives, prerequisites, key_topics
  - Validations: filename must match chapter index, frontmatter required
- **Part**: Folder containing 3-8 chapters
  - Fields: part_number, part_name, description, chapters[], learning_outcomes
  - Validations: folder name format: `NN-Part-Name`
- **CodeExample**: Runnable Python code blocks within chapters
  - Fields: language, code, output, explanation, type_hints_required, tested
  - Validations: must have type hints, docstrings, passing tests

### 1.2 Docusaurus Configuration

**Key Files to Create/Update**:
1. **`book-source/sidebars.js`**: Navigation structure (7 parts → 32 chapters)
2. **`book-source/docusaurus.config.js`**: Site configuration, metadata, plugins
3. **`book-source/package.json`**: Dependencies (docusaurus, build scripts)

### 1.3 Directory Creation & Validation

**Tasks**:
1. Create 7 part folders in `book-source/docs/`
2. Create 32 chapter placeholder files (YAML frontmatter + stub content)
3. Create Docusaurus configuration files
4. Validate directory structure matches chapter-index.md

### 1.4 Chapter Template

All chapters follow `.claude/output-styles/chapters.md` template:
- Front matter (title, sidebar_position, description)
- Learning objectives (Bloom's aligned)
- Content sections (show-then-explain pedagogy)
- Code examples (Python 3.13+ with type hints)
- Exercises (aligned to objectives)
- Common mistakes
- AI Exercise (starting Ch 3)
- Assessment

---

## Phase 2: Quality Validation

### 2.1 Docusaurus Build

- ✅ Verify `npm run build` succeeds
- ✅ Check for broken links (both internal and external)
- ✅ Validate all images render
- ✅ Verify sidebar navigation is correct

### 2.2 Content Validation

- ✅ All 32 chapter files exist in correct locations
- ✅ All filenames match chapter-index.md exactly
- ✅ All frontmatter follows template
- ✅ No broken internal links (Chapter N references)
- ✅ All code examples have type hints (where applicable)

### 2.3 Navigation Validation

- ✅ Docusaurus sidebar correctly organizes 7 parts
- ✅ All 32 chapters appear in navigation
- ✅ Sidebar_position values ensure correct ordering
- ✅ Reading paths can be implemented via sidebar re-ordering

---

## Deliverables

| Artifact | Location | Status | Purpose |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| Implemented directory structure | `book-source/docs/01-*` through `07-*` | To Create | Physical book organization |
| Docusaurus configuration | `book-source/docusaurus.config.js` | To Create | Site metadata and build configuration |
| Sidebar navigation | `book-source/sidebars.js` | To Create | Chapter navigation and organization |
| Chapter placeholders | 32 `.md` files in part folders | To Create | Ready for writers to fill in |
| Validation report | `specs/002-book-structure/validation.md` | To Create | Quality assurance results |

---

## Success Criteria (Execution-Level)

- ✅ All 7 part folders created in `book-source/docs/`
- ✅ All 32 chapter files created with correct names and structure
- ✅ Docusaurus builds successfully with zero errors
- ✅ All 32 chapters appear in sidebar navigation
- ✅ Chapter filenames match chapter-index.md 100%
- ✅ Directory structure matches planned layout exactly
- ✅ Writers can immediately begin writing chapters without structural confusion
- ✅ Docusaurus preview renders correctly with all chapters visible

---

## Notes & Assumptions

1. **No modifications to Constitution**: All structure decisions align with v2.0.0
2. **Chapter order is final**: 32 chapters in 7 parts (5+4+4+8+5+3+3) is non-negotiable
3. **Markdown as content language**: Not planning alternatives (PDF, HTML, etc.)
4. **Docusaurus as build tool**: Already in use; not considering alternatives
5. **Writers will come later**: This phase creates empty structure only; /sp.implement will handle writing
6. **Chapter filenames are immutable**: Changing names requires constitutional amendment
