- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - ✓ Success criteria describe outcomes from writer/architect perspective, not system internals
  - ✓ No database, programming language, or tool specifics in success criteria

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - ✓ User Story 1: 3 concrete scenarios for chapter assignments
  - ✓ User Story 2: 3 concrete scenarios for quality standards
  - ✓ User Story 3: 3 concrete scenarios for architect planning
  - ✓ User Story 4: 2 concrete scenarios for output styles
  - ✓ User Story 5: 3 concrete scenarios for domain skills

- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - ✓ 3 edge cases documented (cross-part dependencies, mid-project changes, skill updates)

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - ✓ "Out of Scope" section explicitly lists what is NOT included (content writing, code creation, deployment)
  - ✓ "Implementation Constraints" clarifies boundaries (structure only, no content)

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - ✓ 7 explicit assumptions documented (constitution is current, chapter index is authoritative, etc.)
  - ✓ Dependencies on Constitution (Section III) clearly stated

## Cognitive Load Management

- [x] Specification explicitly addresses cognitive load as the main barrier for beginners
- [x] Clear progression documented: Foundation → Tools → Communication → Code → Methodology → Agents → Integration
- [x] Scaffolding strategy clearly defined per part (heavy/moderate/light)
- [x] Concept density targets specified (3-4 Part 1, 3-5 Part 2, 4-5 Part 3, 5-7 Part 4, 4-6 Parts 5-7)
- [x] Learning outcomes documented per part (7 outcomes, 31 total specific outcomes)
- [x] Multiple reading paths provided (4 paths: Linear, Fast Track, Agent+MCP, Python Fundamentals)
- [x] Architectural validation rules specified (concept density, difficulty jumps, Bloom's balance, exercise frequency)
- [x] Teacher/coach role emphasized: gradually disclosing material, providing scaffolding, managing cognitive load

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - ✓ Each FR maps to success criteria (e.g., FR-001 maps to SC-001)
  - ✓ Acceptance scenarios provide testable cases for each user story

- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - ✓ User Story 1 (P1): New writer joins and finds their assignment
  - ✓ User Story 2 (P1): Writer understands quality expectations
  - ✓ User Story 3 (P1): Architect plans work systematically
  - ✓ User Story 4 (P2): Consistency is achieved via centralized output styles
  - ✓ User Story 5 (P2): Domain skills are applied across chapters
  - ✓ All P1 stories are foundation; P2 stories enhance efficiency and consistency

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - ✓ Chapter Index specification (SC-001)
  - ✓ Constitution with principles, skills, non-negotiable rules (SC-002, SC-003, SC-004)
  - ✓ 7-part structure with clear learning outcomes (SC-005)
  - ✓ Output styles for chapters, lessons, code, exercises (SC-006, SC-007, SC-008, SC-009)
  - ✓ Architect plan with dependencies and scaffolding (SC-010, SC-011, SC-012)
  - ✓ Quality gates documented (SC-013)
  - ✓ All artifacts accessible (SC-014)

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - ✓ Spec does not prescribe Docusaurus, Git, or any specific tools
  - ✓ Spec focuses on WHAT (structure, principles, requirements) not HOW (technical implementation)

## Feature Readiness Assessment

**READY FOR PLANNING**: ✅ Yes, all criteria pass (Enhanced with cognitive load management)

### Summary

The specification is **complete, unambiguous, and testable**. It provides comprehensive cognitive load management strategies alongside structural planning. It provides:

1. **Clear user scenarios** with priority levels (P1 for foundational, P2 for enhancements)
2. **14 functional requirements** that are testable and comprehensive
3. **16 success criteria** (14 structural + 2 cognitive load management) with specific, measurable metrics
4. **5 well-defined domain entities** (Chapter, Part, Domain Skill, Output Style, Quality Standard, Dependency Chain)
5. **Explicit scope and constraints** (what is/isn't included)
6. **7 documented assumptions** to prevent ambiguity
7. **3 identified edge cases** with clear handling strategies
8. **Cognitive load management section** with scaffolding strategy, concept density limits, learning outcomes per part, multiple reading paths, and validation rules
9. **4 additional glossary terms** (Cognitive Load, Concept Density, Progressive Disclosure) to support the pedagogical framework

### No Blocking Issues

- ❌ No unclear requirements
- ❌ No missing mandatory sections
- ❌ No contradictions or ambiguities
- ❌ No unresolved clarification markers

### Next Phase

This specification is ready for `/sp.plan` (Architect Plan creation) to define:
- Detailed dependency chains between chapters
- Scaffolding strategy (heavy/moderate/light guidance per part)
- Quality gates and review cycles
- Timeline and resource estimates
- Risk mitigation strategies

## Notes

**Enhancements Applied (Post-Skill Invocation)**:

After invoking the `book-architecture` skill, the specification was enhanced with:
1. Comprehensive cognitive load management section (new)
2. Two new success criteria (SC-015, SC-016) focused on pedagogical validation
3. Detailed scaffolding strategy per part (heavy/moderate/light)
4. Concept density targets per part (3-7 concepts/chapter)
5. Learning outcomes per part (31 specific outcomes across 7 parts)
6. Multiple reading paths for different learner types (4 paths provided)
7. Cognitive validation checklist for architects (concept density, difficulty progression, Bloom's balance)
8. Updated glossary with cognitive load and pedagogical terms

The specification now fully incorporates the book-architecture skill's wisdom about preventing cognitive overload through progressive disclosure, scaffolding, and careful sequencing.

**Status**: Specification is complete and ready for planning.
