# Part 12 Outline: Event-Driven Architecture using Kafka and Dapr

**Created**: 2025-10-29  
**Part Number**: 12  
**Chapters**: 2 (Chapters 43-44)  
**Status**: Outline for scaffolding

## Part Overview

This part introduces event-driven architecture for AI systems using Apache Kafka and Dapr. Event-driven patterns enable scalable, loosely-coupled agent systems that communicate asynchronously.

**Target Audience**: Developers building distributed, event-driven agent systems

**Prerequisites**:
- Part 10 (Docker/Kubernetes)
- Understanding of microservices
- Async programming experience

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Part 12, readers will be able to:
1. Implement event-driven architectures with Apache Kafka
2. Build distributed applications with Dapr
3. Design pub/sub patterns for agent communication
4. Handle event streaming and processing
5. Deploy event-driven systems to production
