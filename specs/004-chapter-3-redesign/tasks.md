## Follow-Ups & Risks

**Risk 1: Over-Complexity of Frameworks**
- **Mitigation**: Break each framework into dedicated section with visual/narrative support; use examples before abstraction; provide comparison tables

**Risk 2: Reader Skepticism on "Billion-Dollar Solo Developer"**
- **Mitigation**: Use specific, verifiable examples (Instagram, WhatsApp, Claude Code) with hard numbers; acknowledge reality check; show $10M-$100M ARR is structurally achievable

**Risk 3: Business Jargon Excludes Readers**
- **Mitigation**: Define every business term inline on first use (ARR, CAC, product-market fit, unit economics) with concrete examples; maintain Grade 7-9 reading level

**Risk 4: PPP Strategy Seems Complex/Overwhelming**
- **Mitigation**: Break into three clear phases with dedicated paragraph per phase; provide real-world example showing how PPP applies; comparison table shows why PPP is risk-reducing

**Risk 5: Existing Chapter 3 Files Contain Content That Doesn't Map to Spec Structure**
- **Mitigation**: Review existing files during prep phase; consolidate/reorganize content to match spec requirements; ensure no valuable insights are lost in reorganization
