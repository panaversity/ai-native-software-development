## User Story Dependencies & Parallel Opportunities

### Sequential Dependencies
```
US1 (Snakes & Ladders) → Foundation for understanding competitive landscape
↓
US2 (Super Orchestrators) → Economics make sense given competitive layers
↓
US3 (Vertical Intelligence) → Architecture needed for PPP strategy
↓
US4 (PPP Strategy) → Actionable entry strategy
↓
US5 (Three Requirements) → Critical success factors for PPP execution
↓
US6 (Integration) → Synthesis and forward bridge
```

### Parallel Opportunities
- **T006-T013 can run in parallel** (Lessons 1-3: Setup, Snakes & Ladders, Super Orchestrators are independent)
- **T014-T017 can run in parallel with T018-T020** (Lessons 4-5: Vertical Intelligence and PPP can be written simultaneously)
- **T022-T024 can run after Lesson 5** (Lesson 6 depends on understanding PPP but is independent of Lessons 1-4)
- **T025-T027 can run in parallel with other lessons** (Lessons 1, 7, 8 have clear content scope)

### Recommended MVP Scope
**Minimum Viable Chapter**: Complete US1 + US2 + Phase 8 validation
- Delivers: Readers understand opportunity (Snakes & Ladders framework) + economics (Super Orchestrators)
- Minimum engagement, maximum impact
- Estimated effort: 4-5 hours
- Then iterate: Add US3, US4, US5 incrementally

---

## Follow-Ups & Risks

**Risk 1: Lesson boundaries unclear or overlap**
- Mitigation: Clear scoping in task descriptions; content inventory from existing files; review for overlap before writing

**Risk 2: Transitions between lessons feel forced**
- Mitigation: Each closing task explicitly addresses bridge to next lesson; validation step T028 checks this

**Risk 3: Reading level inconsistent across lessons**
- Mitigation: Establish style guide in T005; reference during all writing tasks; validation step T029 spot-checks

**Risk 4: Engagement elements unevenly distributed**
- Mitigation: Table mapping lessons to engagement elements; ensure each lesson has appropriate element

**Risk 5: User story acceptance criteria not fully met**
- Mitigation: Each user story phase (T006-T027) explicitly references acceptance scenarios from spec.md

---

## Next Steps After Completion

1. **Technical-Reviewer Subagent**: Validate all success criteria and 40+ checklist items
2. **Human Editor**: Final copy editing, visual review, publication polish
3. **Docosaurus Build**: Test image rendering, link functionality, sidebar navigation
4. **Publication**: Merge to main branch, publish to live site

---

**Status**: Ready for Implementation
**Estimated Total Effort**: 12-16 hours (can be parallelized to 6-8 calendar days with 2 concurrent writers)
**Next Command**: Invoke lesson-writer subagent to create 8 lesson files per this task breakdown
