# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 7 - Bash Essentials for AI-Driven Development

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

All checklist items have been validated and pass:

### Content Quality ✓
- The specification focuses entirely on WHAT learners need to achieve (command-line proficiency) and WHY (to work with AI CLI tools effectively)
- No implementation details about specific shell internals, terminal emulator code, or system architecture
- Written in language accessible to non-technical readers (clear descriptions of user journeys, plain English requirements)
- All mandatory sections are present and complete (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)

### Requirement Completeness ✓
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete and actionable
- Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., FR-001 can be tested by verifying the chapter includes all listed commands)
- Success criteria are measurable (e.g., SC-001 specifies "within 30 seconds", SC-003 specifies "90% of readers")
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on user capabilities, time to completion, task success rates)
- Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format and are concrete and testable
- Edge cases identify important boundary conditions (Windows compatibility, dangerous commands, configuration persistence)
- Scope section clearly defines what is included and explicitly excluded
- Dependencies, assumptions, constraints, and risks are all documented

### Feature Readiness ✓
- Each functional requirement maps to user scenarios and success criteria
- User scenarios are prioritized (P1, P2, P3) and independently testable
- Success criteria are measurable outcomes that can be verified through reader behavior and task completion
- No leakage of implementation details (no mention of specific shell implementations, file system APIs, or terminal rendering mechanisms)

## Notes

The specification is complete and ready for the next phase. The chapter design effectively balances traditional command learning (Part I) with AI-augmented workflows (Part II), which aligns with the book's AI-driven development philosophy. The three-tier user story prioritization ensures an MVP can be delivered with just P1 content while P2 and P3 add progressive value.

**Ready for**: `/sp.plan` to create detailed lesson plans and task breakdown.
