# Part 11 Outline: Data, State, and Memory using PostgreSQL, Graph, and Vector Databases

**Created**: 2025-10-29  
**Part Number**: 11  
**Chapters**: 3 (Chapters 40-42)  
**Status**: Outline for scaffolding

---

## Part Overview

This part teaches persistent state and memory systems for AI agents using three database types: relational (PostgreSQL), graph (Neo4j), and vector (Pinecone/Weaviate). Agents need memory to maintain context, learn from interactions, and retrieve relevant information.

**Target Audience**: Developers building production agents that need persistent state

**Prerequisites**:
- Part 6 (Agentic AI)
- Python database fundamentals
- Understanding of data structures

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Part 11, readers will be able to:
1. Implement agent state persistence with PostgreSQL
2. Build knowledge graphs for agent memory with Neo4j
3. Create semantic search and RAG systems with vector databases
4. Choose appropriate database types for different agent needs
5. Design hybrid database architectures
