## Part Overview

This part teaches containerization and orchestration for AI agent deployment using Docker and Kubernetes. Learners package agents as containers and deploy them at scale using industry-standard tools.

**Target Audience**: Developers ready to deploy agents to production

**Prerequisites**:
- Python and TypeScript applications built in previous parts
- Basic Linux command-line knowledge
- Understanding of networking concepts

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Part 10, readers will be able to:
1. Containerize Python and TypeScript AI applications with Docker
2. Deploy and orchestrate containers with Kubernetes
3. Implement CI/CD pipelines for agent deployment
4. Monitor and scale containerized agents
5. Apply production best practices for AI systems
