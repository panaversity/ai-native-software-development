# Part 9 Outline: Building Realtime and Voice Agents

**Created**: 2025-10-29  
**Part Number**: 9  
**Chapters**: 3 (Chapters 34-36)  
**Status**: Outline for scaffolding

---

## Part Overview

This part teaches building realtime and voice-enabled AI agents using OpenAI Realtime API, WebSockets, and streaming protocols. Learners build interactive, conversational agents that process voice input and generate voice output in real-time.

**Target Audience**: Developers with TypeScript (Part 8) and agent (Part 6) experience

**Prerequisites**:
- Part 6 (Agentic AI)
- Part 8 (TypeScript)
- Understanding of async programming and WebSockets

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Part 9, readers will be able to:
1. Build realtime streaming AI applications
2. Implement voice input/output with OpenAI Realtime API
3. Handle WebSocket connections and bidirectional communication
4. Optimize realtime systems for latency and performance
5. Deploy production realtime agents
