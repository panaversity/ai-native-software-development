## Part Overview

This part introduces TypeScript for Python developers, focusing on realtime and interactive applications. TypeScript is essential for building voice agents, WebSocket servers, and frontend integrations.

**Target Audience**: Python developers (Part 4 complete) expanding to full-stack AI development

**Prerequisites**:
- Python fundamentals (Part 4)
- Understanding of async programming
- Basic web concepts (optional but helpful)

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Part 8, readers will be able to:
1. Write type-safe TypeScript code
2. Build backend services with Node.js and TypeScript
3. Work with async/await patterns in TypeScript
4. Understand TypeScript tooling and ecosystem
5. Prepare for building realtime voice agents (Part 9)
