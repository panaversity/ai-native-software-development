## Part Overview

This part teaches learners to build Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers using FastMCP, enabling deep integration between AI agents and existing systems. MCP provides a standardized way for AI systems to access tools, data sources, and external services.

**Target Audience**: Learners with agent-building experience (Part 6) ready to integrate agents with real-world systems

**Prerequisites**:
- Part 6 (Agentic AI) complete
- Python fundamentals (Part 4)
- Understanding of APIs and web services

---

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Part 7, readers will be able to:
1. Understand MCP architecture and protocol
2. Build MCP servers using FastMCP
3. Integrate MCP servers with AI agents
4. Create custom tools and resources via MCP
5. Deploy and manage MCP servers in production
