```

**Critical Path**: Setup → Foundational → US1 → US2 → US4 → Validation  
**Parallel Opportunities**: US3 and US5 can run in parallel after US1 completes

---

## Independent Test Criteria (Per User Story)

### US1 (P1): Core Documentation
**Test**: Open `constitution.md`, `chapter-index.md`, and `directory-structure.md`. All three accurately reflect 13 parts and 46 chapters with no inconsistencies.

### US2 (P2): Restructure Content
**Test**: All existing chapter folders in `book-source/docs/` match the new chapter mapping. No orphaned files. All content preserved in git history.

### US3 (P3): New Part Scaffolding
**Test**: Each of Parts 6-13 has a complete part spec in `specs/part-N/`, including `part-N-spec.md` and all required chapter spec files.

### US4 (P2): Docusaurus Directories
**Test**: Run `cd book-source && npm run build`. Build succeeds. Open generated site, verify all 13 parts and 46 chapters are navigable in sidebar.

### US5 (P3): README/CLAUDE Updates
**Test**: Open `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`. Both accurately reference 13 parts. CLAUDE.md defers to constitution for structure details.

---

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope**: User Story 1 (Core Documentation) + Chapter Mapping  
**Reason**: Without updated authoritative docs, no other work can proceed safely.

**Incremental Delivery**:
1. **Sprint 1**: US1 (Core Docs) → Enables all other work
2. **Sprint 2**: US2 (Restructure) + US4 (Docusaurus) → Preserves existing content
3. **Sprint 3**: US3 (Scaffolding) + US5 (README) → Adds new structure
4. **Sprint 4**: Polish & Validation → Production-ready

---

## Phase 1: Setup

**Goal**: Initialize task tracking and verify prerequisites

### Tasks

## Phase 7: User Story 5 (P3) - Update README and CLAUDE.md

**Story Goal**: Update project documentation to reflect the 13-part structure for contributors and AI agents.

**Independent Test**: Open `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`. Both files accurately reference 13 parts. CLAUDE.md defers to constitution for details.

**Dependencies**: Can start after US1 completes (needs accurate chapter-index.md). Does NOT need to wait for US2/US3/US4.

### Tasks

- [ ] T034 [P] [US5] Update `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorgpt-build/colearning-python/README.md`
  - Update "Structure Overview" section (lines ~48-62)

  - Check: CLAUDE.md does NOT hardcode chapter/part counts
  - Check: CLAUDE.md references constitution.md for structure details
  - If hardcoded: Replace with references to constitution/chapter-index
  - No changes needed if already compliant from v2.1.0 refactor

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ README.md lists all 13 parts with correct chapter counts
- ✅ CLAUDE.md defers to constitution for structure (no hardcoded counts)
- ✅ Both files use exact part titles from chapter-index.md
- ✅ Changes committed to git

---

## Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Validation

**Story Goal**: Validate the entire restructuring, fix broken links, and ensure production readiness.

**Independent Test**: All acceptance criteria from US1-US5 pass. Docusaurus builds successfully for all 13 parts.

### Tasks

- [ ] T036 [P] [Polish] Create Docusaurus scaffolding for Parts 8-13 in `/Users/mjs/Documents/code/panaversity-official/tutorgpt-build/colearning-python/book-source/docs/`
  - Create folders: `08-TypeScript-Realtime-Interaction/` through `13-Dapr-Stateful-Agents/`
  - Each folder: `intro.md` + placeholder chapter folders with `README.md`
  - Use directory-structure.md naming conventions

- [ ] T037 [P] [Polish] Run full Docusaurus build validation
  - Run: `cd book-source && npm run build`
  - Verify: Build succeeds with zero errors
  - Verify: All 13 parts visible in sidebar
  - Verify: All 46 chapters navigable (placeholder content OK)

- [ ] T038 [Polish] Validate all internal cross-references using validation checklist (from T005)
  - Check all files that reference chapter numbers
  - Update any hardcoded references to old chapter numbers
  - Verify no broken internal links in Markdown files

- [ ] T039 [Polish] Final review and merge preparation
  - Review all changed files for consistency
  - Verify all 5 user stories meet acceptance criteria
  - Create pull request summary with before/after comparison
  - Tag commit: `v2.2.0-structure-expansion`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ All 13 parts have Docusaurus scaffolding
- ✅ Docusaurus build succeeds for full structure
- ✅ All internal references validated and updated
- ✅ All user story acceptance criteria pass
- ✅ Ready for pull request / merge to main

---

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Parallel Group 1 (After T005 completes):
Can run simultaneously:
- T006 (Update constitution.md)
- T007 (Update chapter-index.md)
- T008 (Update directory-structure.md)

**Why**: Different files, no dependencies between them. All reference research.md.

### Parallel Group 2 (After US1 completes):
Can run simultaneously:
- All of US3 (T025-T032) - Creating part specs
- All of US5 (T034-T035) - Updating README/CLAUDE.md

**Why**: US3 and US5 are both P3 stories with no dependencies on US2/US4. Can proceed as soon as US1 is done.

### Parallel Group 3 (Within US3):
Can run simultaneously:
- T025 through T032 (all 8 part spec files)

**Why**: Each part spec is an independent file with no dependencies on other parts.

### Parallel Group 4 (Within Phase 8):
Can run simultaneously:
- T036 (Create Docusaurus scaffolding)
- T037 (Run build validation)

**Why**: Can create folders and test build in parallel (build will pass even with placeholder content).

## MVP Scope (Minimal Viable Product)

**Recommended MVP**: Complete through Phase 3 (User Story 1)

**What This Delivers**:
- ✅ Constitution updated with 13-part structure
- ✅ Chapter index lists all 46 chapters
- ✅ Directory structure doc updated
- ✅ Chapter mapping document created
- ✅ Part templates created

**Why This Is Viable**:
- AI agents can now reference accurate structure information
- All future work (US2-US5) can proceed based on these authoritative docs
- Can pause here for review/feedback before restructuring content

**Value**: Foundation established, zero risk to existing content

---

## Notes

**Content Preservation Strategy**:
- All restructuring tasks preserve old content in git history
- Backup tags created before major changes (T012)
- chapter-mapping.md provides bidirectional tracing

**Docusaurus Compatibility**:
- All folder names follow conventions from directory-structure.md
- `_category_.json` files updated where needed
- Build validation after each major phase

**Rollback Plan**:
- Each phase commits separately
- Can cherry-pick or revert by phase
- Backup tags enable full rollback if needed

---

## Task Checklist Validation

✅ **All 39 tasks follow required format**:
- Checkbox (`- [ ]`)
- Task ID (T001-T039)
- [P] marker where parallelizable
- [US#] label for user story tasks
- Description with absolute file path

✅ **All tasks are independently executable by LLM**

✅ **All user stories map to specific tasks**

✅ **Dependencies clearly documented**
