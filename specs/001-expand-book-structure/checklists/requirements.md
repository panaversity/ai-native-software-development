# Specification Quality Checklist: Expand Book Structure

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-29  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Results**: All items pass ✅

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear progression from documentation updates → content restructuring → new part scaffolding → directory reorganization
- User stories are properly prioritized with P1 (constitution/docs) as the foundation
- All 15 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "Docusaurus build completes successfully" rather than specifying build tool implementation)
- Edge cases thoughtfully cover content consolidation, chapter renumbering, and cross-reference management
- No implementation details (the spec doesn't specify HOW to update files, just WHAT must be updated)

**Clarifications**: None needed - the feature scope is well-defined and based on existing project conventions.
