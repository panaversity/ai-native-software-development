## Content Preservation Strategy

**All old content is preserved via**:
1. **Git history**: All original chapters tagged before restructuring
2. **This mapping**: Bidirectional tracing (old ↔ new)
3. **Merge commits**: Clear commit messages for each consolidation

**No content deleted**, only reorganized or integrated into new structure.

---

## Usage Guide

### For Content Migration
- Use "Action" column to determine what to do with each old chapter
- KEEP: Renumber only, preserve content
- MERGE: Combine content from multiple chapters
- RENUMBER: Update chapter number references
- NEW: Create fresh scaffolding

### For Cross-Reference Updates
- Use reverse mapping to find new chapter numbers when updating links
- Search for old chapter numbers in existing content
- Replace with new chapter numbers from this mapping

### For Validation
- Verify all 32 old chapters are accounted for
- Verify all 46 new chapters have source material or are marked NEW
- Check that no content is lost during consolidation
