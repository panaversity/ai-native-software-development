# Tasks: Chapter 8 - Git & GitHub for AI-Driven Development

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-chapter-8-git-github/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories)

**Tests**: Tests are NOT requested in this feature specification. This is an educational content project, not a software implementation project.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by lesson (content unit) to enable independent implementation and delivery of each lesson.

## Format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Lesson] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Lesson]**: Which lesson this task belongs to (e.g., L1, L2, L3, L4, L5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Book content**: `book-source/docs/02-AI-Tool-Landscape/08-git-and-github/`
- **Spec artifacts**: `specs/001-chapter-8-git-github/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1 (Foundation)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Phase 2 (User Story 1)**: Depends on Phase 1 completion
- **Phase 3 (User Story 2)**: Depends on Phase 2 completion (learners need basic Git skills first)
- **Phase 4 (User Story 3)**: Depends on Phases 2-3 completion (prompts assume understanding of core concepts)
- **Phase 5 (User Story 4)**: Can proceed in parallel with Phases 2-4 (content integration tasks)
- **Phase 6 (Polish)**: Depends on all user story phases being complete

### Lesson Dependencies

- **Lesson 1 (Why)**: Can start after Phase 1 - No dependencies on other lessons
- **Lesson 2 (Essentials)**: Depends on Lesson 1 (motivation established)
- **Lesson 3 (Safe Experimentation)**: Depends on Lesson 2 (basic workflow understood)
- **Lesson 4 (Pull Requests)**: Depends on Lesson 3 (branching and merging understood)
- **Lesson 5 (Natural Language)**: Depends on Lessons 2-4 (core concepts understood, prompts are convenience layer)

### Within Each Lesson

- Content sections can be written sequentially (Part I â†’ Part II â†’ Part III...)
- Exercises must follow content completion (can't write exercises before content)
- Assessments must follow exercises (can't assess what hasn't been practiced)

### Parallel Opportunities

- Phase 6 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- User Story 4 content integration tasks (T035-T037) can run in parallel with each other
- Platform testing tasks (T041-T043) can run in parallel
- Accessibility, style, constitution, and coherence checks (T044-T047) can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: Phase 6 (Polish)

```bash
# Launch all polish tasks together:
Task: "Create comprehensive project in 06-comprehensive-project.md"
Task: "Create Quick Reference Card in reference-card.md"
Task: "Create Common Scenarios Reference in common-scenarios.md"
Task: "Accessibility check: grade 7 reading level"
Task: "Style guide compliance verification"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1: Safe Checkpoints)

1. Complete Phase 1: Chapter Foundation
2. Complete Phase 2: User Story 1 (Lessons 1-3)
3. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test Lesson 1-3 independently
4. Learners can now create safe checkpoints and rollback - **Core value delivered**

### Incremental Delivery

1. MVP (Lessons 1-3) â†’ Learners have safety net for AI development
2. Add User Story 2 (Lesson 4) â†’ Learners can collaborate via PRs
3. Add User Story 3 (Lesson 5) â†’ Learners have natural language convenience layer
4. Add User Story 4 (integrated) â†’ Learners can track AI contributions
5. Add Phase 6 (Polish) â†’ Comprehensive project and references
6. Each phase adds value without breaking previous lessons

### Sequential Lesson Strategy

Since this is an educational content project:

1. Write Lesson 1 (foundation) â†’ Review â†’ Approve
2. Write Lesson 2 (essentials) â†’ Review â†’ Approve
3. Write Lesson 3 (experimentation) â†’ Review â†’ Approve
4. Write Lesson 4 (PRs) â†’ Review â†’ Approve
5. Write Lesson 5 (prompts) â†’ Review â†’ Approve
6. Create polish artifacts (project, references) â†’ Review
7. Quality checks (platform testing, accessibility, etc.) â†’ Final review

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Lesson] label maps task to specific lesson for traceability
- Each lesson should be independently completable and reviewable
- Commit after each lesson or logical section completion
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate lesson independently
- This is **educational content**, not software - no automated tests needed
- Platform testing means **manually testing commands** on different OS platforms
- Natural language prompts must be tested with **actual AI tools** (Claude Code, Gemini CLI)

- **Phase 4 (User Story 3)**: 3-4 hours (1 lesson with exercises and assessment)
- **Phase 5 (User Story 4)**: 1-2 hours (content integration)
- **Phase 6 (Polish)**: 4-6 hours (project, references, quality checks)

**Total Estimated Effort**: 21-29 hours (assumes sequential lesson-by-lesson implementation)

---

## Follow-Up Sequence

After task generation completes:

1. **Begin MVP Implementation**: Start with Phase 1 and Phase 2 (User Story 1)
2. **Human Review**: After each lesson is drafted, human reviews and provides feedback
3. **Iterative Delivery**: Complete each user story phase and validate before moving to next
4. **Quality Assurance**: Phase 6 ensures publication readiness
5. **Technical Validation**: Use technical-reviewer agent after all content complete
