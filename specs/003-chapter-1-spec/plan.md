**Duration**: 50-65 minutes
**Word Count**: 600-800 words
**Learning Objective (Bloom's)**: Understand what "agent-native education" means and explain the three roles of AI in this book (co-learner, collaborator, creative partner)

**Content Outline**:
- **The Terminology**: "Agent-native" = AI participates actively, not passively
- **The Three Roles** (each gets a subsection with examples):
  - **Co-learner**: AI explores with you, asks questions, suggests directions for investigation
  - **Collaborator**: AI shapes ideas, refines specifications, suggests architectures, participates in decision-making
  - **Creative Partner**: AI amplifies your capability, generates code, produces ideas you then evaluate and refine
- **Critical Distinction**: "Learning WITH AI" vs. "Learning FROM AI"
  - WITH: You direct, iterate, evaluate, make decisions
  - FROM: You passively consume AI-generated content
- **How This Book Embodies It**:
  - Every chapter uses specifications (you'll write them with AI help)
  - AI generates code; you evaluate and refine
  - Exercises invite you to work WITH AI, not ask AI to do something for you
  - Examples show both the prompt and the AI's response (you see the thinking)
- **What to Expect**: Specifications, directing AI partners, understanding reasoning, practicing with the tools

**Key Concepts Introduced**:
- Agent-native education (definition and philosophy)
- Co-learner role (AI as exploration partner)
- Collaborator role (AI as idea-shaper)
- Creative partner role (AI as capability amplifier)
- "Learning WITH" vs. "Learning FROM" distinction (critical for psychological ownership)

**Pedagogical Approach**:
- **Show**: Present examples of AI in each role (with minimal explanation first)
- **Explain**: Define each role and the distinction between WITH and FROM
- **Connect**: Link to the book's structure and what readers will experience
- **Set Expectations**: Explain why this model prepares readers for real-world AI-driven development

**Domain Skills Applied**:
- **ai-augmented-teaching** (central to this lesson): Explain the pedagogy of AI-as-partner and why it matters
- **learning-objectives**: Ensure learners understand what they'll be doing WITH AI in upcoming chapters
- **technical-clarity**: Define three roles clearly; explain WITH vs. FROM distinction
- **book-scaffolding**: This lesson sets expectations for pedagogical model throughout Parts 2-7

**Assessment**:
- Formative: Comprehension question: "Explain the difference between learning WITH AI and learning FROM AI."
- Success metric from spec: 85%+ of readers understand agent-native education model

**Visual Resources**:

**Learning Objective (Bloom's)**: Evaluate and apply the four dimensions of an agent orchestrator role and justify why these skills are more valuable than syntax knowledge

**Content Outline**:
- **Recap and Formalize**: "Agent orchestrator" as the unified concept (introduced in Lesson 1, now fully defined)
- **Four Dimensions** (each gets subsection):
  1. **Specification Writer**: Write clear requirements that precede implementation; AI uses specs to generate code
  2. **System Architect**: Design intelligent system topology; decide what agents do, how they interact, what protocols they use
  3. **Agent Director**: Guide AI partners toward good solutions; prompt engineering, iteration, course correction
  4. **Quality Arbiter**: Evaluate and refine AI-generated work; verify correctness, assess trade-offs, make final decisions

  - Syntax changes; architecture principles endure
  - Anyone can memorize syntax; orchestrators think in systems
  - AI generates syntax; humans orchestrate intelligence
  - Transferable across languages, frameworks, domains
- **How They Apply Across Domains**: Show how orchestrator skills apply to finance, healthcare, education (connects to Lesson 3)
- **Your Journey**: Lessons 1-5 have prepared you; Parts 2-7 will develop each dimension

**Key Concepts Introduced**:
- Agent orchestrator (formal, complete definition)
- Specification writing (foundational skill for all orchestrators)
- System architecture (designing intelligent systems)
- Agent direction (prompt engineering, iteration)
- Quality arbitration (evaluation and refinement)

**Pedagogical Approach**:
- **Review-Anchor**: Anchor the concept to Lesson 1's introduction for continuity
- **Explain-Expand**: Formally define and expand the concept with four clear dimensions
- **Justify**: Explain why these skills transcend technical details
- **Motivate**: Show how these skills lead to valuable work across domains
- **Preview**: Briefly preview how Parts 2-7 develop each dimension

**Domain Skills Applied**:
- **learning-objectives**: Ensure learners can evaluate their development across four dimensions in later chapters
- **concept-scaffolding**: Four dimensions scaffold the entire remaining content; each part of the book develops one or more dimensions
- **book-scaffolding**: This lesson maps the four dimensions to Parts 2-7; provides conceptual backbone for entire curriculum
- **technical-clarity**: Define all four terms clearly; explain WHY these transcend syntax

**Assessment**:
- Formative: "Explain what a 'quality arbiter' does and why it's important"
- Implicit success: Reader sees connection between their current skills and the orchestrator role ahead

**Visual Resources**:
- **Diagram 3 (critical)**: "Agent Orchestrator — Four Dimensions" with clear definitions and examples

## Next Steps (For Lesson-Writer Subagent)

1. **Implement each lesson** using the lesson structure defined in `.claude/output-styles/lesson.md`
2. **Create visuals/diagrams** as described in Visual Resources section
3. **Embed code examples** from AI Coding Revolution Paper or create new examples following code standards
4. **Write reflection exercises** with clear prompts and expected depth
5. **Include comprehension checks** with 3-4 questions per lesson (answer key provided to teacher/reviewer)
6. **Format chapter** for Docusaurus with YAML frontmatter
7. **Cross-check** against Constitution Principle alignment and domain skills
8. **Validate** that all 8 domain skills are visibly applied in final content
