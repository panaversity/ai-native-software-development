## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|
| Overwhelming beginners with nine pillars | Medium | High | Emphasize progressive learning; use storytelling; include reassurance |
| Tool capabilities become outdated | Low | Medium | Verify 2025 status; use fallback language if tools change |
| Insufficient concrete examples | Medium | Medium | Apply all 7 content enrichment patterns; include 5-8 stories |
| Inconsistency with Chapter 2 | Low | Medium | Clearly distinguish "what changed" (Ch2) vs "what to do" (Ch4) |
| Reading level too complex | Low | High | Validate grade 7 baseline; define jargon; use analogies |

## Follow-Ups & Next Steps

**After Chapter 4 Completion**:
1. Technical review validation (technical-reviewer subagent)
2. Peer review for pedagogical effectiveness
3. Accessibility audit
4. Cross-chapter coherence check with Chapters 1-3 and 5+
5. Docusaurus build validation (no warnings/errors)

**Next Task**: Chapter 5 planning and writing (Debugging and Iterating with AI)
