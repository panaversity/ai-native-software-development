# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 4 - The Nine Pillars of AI-Driven Development (AIDD)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [Chapter 4 Specification](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders (accessible to readers with minimal tech background)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (4 user stories: AIDD Foundation, Nine Pillars Deep Dive, M-Shaped Developer, Competitive Implications)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

### Validation Results (2025-10-29)

**Status**: ✅ PASSED — All checklist items complete

**Content Quality Assessment**:
- Specification is appropriately conceptual/educational for a book chapter
- Written at grade 7 reading level with professional terminology explained
- Focus on learning outcomes and reader value (not technical implementation)
- All mandatory sections present and complete

**Requirement Quality Assessment**:
- 12 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-012) all testable
- 8 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-008) all measurable and technology-agnostic
- User stories well-structured with priorities, rationale, and acceptance scenarios
- Edge cases anticipated and addressed
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present

**Feature Readiness Assessment**:
- Chapter scope clearly defined: introduce AIDD methodology and nine pillars
- Distinguished from Chapter 2 (technological revolutions vs methodology pillars)
- Dependencies clearly documented (earlier chapters, constitution, output styles, domain skills)
- Risks identified with mitigation strategies
- Assumptions documented (scaffolding level, content type, length targets)

**Specific Strengths**:
1. Clear differentiation between Chapter 2 (nine technological revolutions) and Chapter 4 (nine methodology pillars)
2. Well-structured user stories prioritized by learning value
3. Comprehensive success criteria covering comprehension, retention, and motivation
4. Strong emphasis on accessibility (Principle 8) and progressive learning (Principle 5)
5. Content Enrichment Patterns explicitly documented for implementation phase

**Ready for Next Phase**: ✅ YES
- Proceed to `/sp.plan` to create implementation plan
- No clarifications needed
- All requirements clear and actionable
