**Chapter Type**: Hybrid (Narrative Foundation + Technical Tutorials)
**Chapter Location**: Part 2, Chapter 5 (AI Tool Landscape)
**Approved Specification**: `specs/005-chapter-5-spec/spec.md`
**Status**: Ready for Implementation
**Estimated Total Time**: 75-95 minutes (30-35 min reading + 45-60 min hands-on)

## Chapter Overview

This chapter serves as the primary tutorial introduction to Claude Code for beginners who have completed Part 1 (Chapters 1-4). It combines narrative storytelling about Claude Code's origins with comprehensive, hands-on tutorials for installation, authentication, subagents, Agent Skills, and MCP integration.

**Learning Trajectory**:
- Start with "why" (Claude Code's paradigm shift) → Understand the tool's capabilities
- Move to "how" (installation, authentication) → Get the tool working
- Progress to "what now" (subagents, skills, MCP) → Learn advanced features progressively
- End with "where next" (common workflows, reflection) → Prepare for deeper exploration

### Lesson 3: Understanding and Using Subagents
**Duration**: 25-32 min | **Bloom's**: Apply | **Type**: Technical

Create your first subagent and learn when specialization provides value.

**Content**: Subagent architecture, context isolation, code-reviewer tutorial, use cases, management commands
**Assessment**: Create working subagent, explain difference from main conversation
**Success Target**: 80% create custom subagent and explain usage (SC-004)

### Lesson 4: Creating and Using Agent Skills
**Duration**: 32-39 min | **Bloom's**: Create | **Type**: Technical

Build a custom Agent Skill and understand competitive advantage of domain-specific skill libraries.

**Content**: Skill structure, SKILL.md format, model-invoked discovery, python-docstring-writer tutorial, naming best practices
**Assessment**: Create skill with autonomous discovery, clear naming/description
**Success Target**: 80% create custom skill with autonomous discovery (SC-005)

### Lesson 5: Connecting MCP Servers and Common Workflows
**Duration**: 32-39 min | **Bloom's**: Apply | **Type**: Technical/Practical

Integrate external services and demonstrate real-world Claude Code workflows.

**Content**: MCP architecture, GitHub MCP setup, end-to-end workflow examples, security guidance, 4 common workflows
**Assessment**: Connect MCP server, use in practical task, explain security considerations
**Success Target**: 75% successfully connect and use MCP in task (SC-006)

## Progressive Scaffolding Strategy

**Pyramid of Complexity** (Bloom's taxonomy aligned):
1. **Foundation (L1)**: Understand paradigm - Narrative, minimal cognitive load
2. **Practical Setup (L2)**: Install & authenticate - Step-by-step, success building
3. **First Advanced (L3)**: Subagents - Concrete examples, clear use cases
4. **Second Advanced (L4)**: Skills - Abstract concept, template-based
5. **Integration (L5)**: MCP - Highest complexity, real-world grounded

**Scaffolding Checkpoints**:
- After L2: Readers have working tool → confidence boost
- After L3: Readers can specialize Claude Code → empowerment
- After L4: Readers can build skill libraries → ownership
- After L5: Readers can integrate external tools → professionalism

## Integration with Book Structure

**Part 2 (Chapters 5-8): AI Tool Landscape**
- Ch 5 (this): Claude Code deep-dive (terminal-based)
- Ch 6: Gemini CLI (another terminal tool)
- Ch 7: GitHub Copilot (IDE-integrated)
- Ch 8: Choosing the right tool (comparison)

**Prior Chapters** (1-4): Established AI-first philosophy and AIDD framework
**Subsequent**: Operationalizes concepts in Python (Ch 10+), Spec-Kit (Ch 22+), Agents (Ch 25+)
