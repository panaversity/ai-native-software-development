# Chapter 5: How It All Started: The Claude Code Phenomenon — Task Checklist (REFINED)

**Chapter Type**: Hybrid (Narrative Foundation + Technical Tutorials)
**Status**: Ready for Implementation
**Feature Branch**: `005-chapter-5-spec`
**Approved Plan**: `specs/005-chapter-5-spec/plan.md`
**Estimated Total Effort**: 50-65 hours (reduced through subagent specialization)
**Implementation Strategy**: 5 parallel lesson-writer subagents + 1 integration phase

---

## Overview

This refined task checklist assigns each lesson to a **dedicated lesson-writer subagent** with **content-evaluation-framework** skill integration. Tasks now follow strict checklist format with Task IDs, [P] markers for parallelizable work, and clear file paths.

**Key Changes from Original**:
1. ✅ Each lesson assigned to separate lesson-writer subagent
2. ✅ content-evaluation-framework skill requirement added to all lessons
3. ✅ Strict checklist format enforced (Task IDs, [P] markers, file paths)
4. ✅ Reduced task granularity (subagents handle internal subtasks)
5. ✅ Clear subagent invocation specifications

**Chapter Scope**: 5 lessons totaling 75-95 minutes (30-35 reading + 45-60 hands-on)
- Lesson 1: Origin story (narrative) → lesson-writer-1
- Lesson 2: Installation & authentication (technical) → lesson-writer-2
- Lesson 3: Subagents tutorial (technical) → lesson-writer-3
- Lesson 4: Agent Skills tutorial (technical) → lesson-writer-4
- Lesson 5: MCP servers & workflows (technical/practical) → lesson-writer-5

## Overall Effort Summary

| Phase | Lesson(s) | Hours | Parallelizable? |
|-------|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| Phase 1 | Lesson 1 | 12.5 h | ✅ Yes (T001-T003) |
| Phase 2 | Lesson 2 | 24.5 h | ⚠️ Partial (T004-T005 parallel, then T006-T008 sequential) |
| Phase 3 | Lesson 3 | 19.5 h | ⚠️ Partial (T009-T010 parallel, then T011-T013 sequential) |
| Phase 4 | Lesson 4 | 23.5 h | ⚠️ Partial (T014-T016 parallel, then T017-T020 sequential) |
| Phase 5 | Lesson 5 | 34 h | ⚠️ Partial (T021-T025 parallel, then T026-T029 sequential) |
| Phase 6 | Integration | 17 h | ❌ No (depends on all lessons) |
| **TOTAL** | **All** | **131 h** | **~6-8 weeks with parallel work** |

**Key Efficiency Gains**:
- **38.5 hours saved** from original 169.5h estimate through:
  - Subagent specialization (reduced task switching overhead)
  - Consolidated review tasks
  - Parallel prerequisite development (T004-T005, T009-T010, T014-T016, T021-T025)
  - Self-evaluation embedded in lesson creation (no separate evaluation phase)

**Parallelization Strategy**:
- **Week 1-2**: All prerequisite tasks (T004-T005, T009-T010, T014-T016, T021-T025) in parallel = 32.5 hours
- **Week 3-5**: All lesson writing tasks (T001, T006, T011, T017, T026) can start once prerequisites complete
- **Week 6**: All review tasks (T002-T003, T007-T008, T012-T013, T018-T020, T027-T029)
- **Week 7-8**: Integration phase (T030-T039)

**Actual calendar time**: 6-8 weeks (versus 8-11 weeks in original plan)

## Handoff Specifications for Lesson-Writer Subagents

### Standard Invocation Pattern

For each lesson (T001, T006, T011, T017, T026), use the Task tool with subagent_type="lesson-writer".

### Subagent Context Provided

Each lesson-writer subagent receives:
1. **Specification**: `specs/005-chapter-5-spec/spec.md` (requirements, success criteria)
2. **Plan**: `specs/005-chapter-5-spec/plan.md` (lesson details, Bloom's levels, time estimates)
3. **Output Style**: `.claude/output-styles/lesson.md` (formatting template)
4. **Constitution**: `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (principles and standards)
5. **Prerequisite Artifacts**: Code examples, verified commands, research (task-specific)

### Expected Deliverables from Each Subagent

1. **Primary Lesson Content**: Markdown file with full lesson following output style
2. **Self-Evaluation Report**: Using content-evaluation-framework skill
   - Technical Accuracy score and findings
   - Pedagogical Effectiveness score and findings
   - Writing Quality score and findings
   - Structure & Organization score and findings
   - AI-First Teaching score and findings
   - Constitution Compliance (Pass/Fail)
   - Overall weighted score
   - Recommendations for improvement
3. **Metadata**: YAML frontmatter with all required fields
