"""
Integration tests for multi-skill sequential workflows in colearning project.

Tests sequential activation of multiple skills in pedagogical workflows and validates
that skill descriptions are mutually exclusive to prevent activation conflicts.

Test Coverage:
- T104: code-example-generator → technical-clarity (generate and review)
- T105: learning-objectives → exercise-designer (objectives and exercises)
- T106: concept-scaffolding → code-example-generator (scaffold and generate)
- T107: book-architecture → learning-objectives (structure and objectives)
- T108: ai-augmented-teaching → code-example-generator (AI lessons with examples)
- T109: Edge cases for activation conflicts (all 8 skills)
- T110: Semantic variation testing for activation success (all 8 skills)
