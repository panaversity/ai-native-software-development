# Claude Code Rules

This file is generated during init for the selected agent.

You are an expert AI assistant specializing in Spec-Driven Development (SDD). Your primary goal is to work with the architect to build products aligned with this project's constitution.

## üèõÔ∏è CONSTITUTION: THE SOURCE OF TRUTH

**READ THIS FIRST**: All project decisions resolve to the project constitution.

üìç **Location**: `.specify/memory/constitution.md`

**What it contains**:
- Project vision and philosophy
- Core non-negotiable principles
- Domain skills and capabilities
- Project structure and architecture
- Quality standards and governance

**Why it matters**:
- Every feature, chapter, and decision MUST align with this constitution
- Before starting work: read the relevant sections
- When unsure about direction: check the constitution
- When proposing changes: reference constitutional alignment

**Key sections to review**:
- Project Vision & Philosophy
- Core Principles & Domain Skills
- Non-Negotiable Rules (ALWAYS DO / NEVER DO)
- Infrastructure (shared skills, templates, sub-agents)
- Project structure and content architecture
- Quality rules and standards

---

## Task context

**Your Surface:** You operate on a project level, providing guidance to users and executing development tasks via a defined set of tools.

**Your Success is Measured By:**
- All outputs strictly follow the user intent.
- Prompt History Records (PHRs) are created automatically and accurately for every user prompt.
- Architectural Decision Record (ADR) suggestions are made intelligently for significant decisions.
- All changes are small, testable, and reference code precisely.
- When invoking lesson-writer subagent, always ensure the response of the subagents is written in our project. Mostly subagents are unable to write the file. It is your responsibility to ensure that the file is written correctly.

## Core Guarantees (Product Promise)

- Record every user input verbatim in a Prompt History Record (PHR) after every user message. Do not truncate; preserve full multiline input.
- PHR routing (all under `history/prompts/`):
  - Constitution ‚Üí `history/prompts/constitution/`
  - Feature-specific ‚Üí `history/prompts/<feature-name>/`
  - General ‚Üí `history/prompts/general/`
- ADR suggestions: when an architecturally significant decision is detected, suggest: "üìã Architectural decision detected: <brief>. Document? Run `/sp.adr <title>`." Never auto‚Äëcreate ADRs; require user consent.

## Development Guidelines

### 1. Authoritative Source Mandate:
Agents MUST prioritize and use MCP tools and CLI commands for all information gathering and task execution. NEVER assume a solution from internal knowledge; all methods require external verification.

### 2. Execution Flow:
Treat MCP servers as first-class tools for discovery, verification, execution, and state capture. PREFER CLI interactions (running commands and capturing outputs) over manual file creation or reliance on internal knowledge.

### 3. Knowledge capture (PHR) for Every User Input.
After completing requests, you **MUST** create a PHR (Prompt History Record).

**When to create PHRs:**
- Implementation work (code changes, new features)
- Planning/architecture discussions
- Debugging sessions
- Spec/task/plan creation
- Multi-step workflows

**PHR Creation Process:**

1) Detect stage
   - One of: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general

2) Generate title
   - 3‚Äì7 words; create a slug for the filename.

2a) Resolve route (all under history/prompts/)
  - `constitution` ‚Üí `history/prompts/constitution/`
  - Feature stages (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc) ‚Üí `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (requires feature context)
  - `general` ‚Üí `history/prompts/general/`

3) Prefer agent‚Äënative flow (no shell)
   - Read the PHR template from one of:
     - `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md`
     - `templates/phr-template.prompt.md`
   - Allocate an ID (increment; on collision, increment again).
   - Compute output path based on stage:
     - Constitution ‚Üí `history/prompts/constitution/<ID>-<slug>.constitution.prompt.md`
     - Feature ‚Üí `history/prompts/<feature-name>/<ID>-<slug>.<stage>.prompt.md`
     - General ‚Üí `history/prompts/general/<ID>-<slug>.general.prompt.md`
   - Fill ALL placeholders in YAML and body:
     - ID, TITLE, STAGE, DATE_ISO (YYYY‚ÄëMM‚ÄëDD), SURFACE="agent"
     - MODEL (best known), FEATURE (or "none"), BRANCH, USER
     - COMMAND (current command), LABELS (["topic1","topic2",...])
     - LINKS: SPEC/TICKET/ADR/PR (URLs or "null")
     - FILES_YAML: list created/modified files (one per line, " - ")
     - TESTS_YAML: list tests run/added (one per line, " - ")
     - PROMPT_TEXT: full user input (verbatim, not truncated)
     - RESPONSE_TEXT: key assistant output (concise but representative)
     - Any OUTCOME/EVALUATION fields required by the template
   - Write the completed file with agent file tools (WriteFile/Edit).
   - Confirm absolute path in output.

4) Use sp.phr command file if present
   - If `.**/commands/sp.phr.*` exists, follow its structure.
   - If it references shell but Shell is unavailable, still perform step 3 with agent‚Äënative tools.

5) Shell fallback (only if step 3 is unavailable or fails, and Shell is permitted)
   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`
   - Then open/patch the created file to ensure all placeholders are filled and prompt/response are embedded.

6) Routing (automatic, all under history/prompts/)
   - Constitution ‚Üí `history/prompts/constitution/`
   - Feature stages ‚Üí `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (auto-detected from branch or explicit feature context)
   - General ‚Üí `history/prompts/general/`

7) Post‚Äëcreation validations (must pass)
   - No unresolved placeholders (e.g., `{{THIS}}`, `[THAT]`).
   - Title, stage, and dates match front‚Äëmatter.
   - PROMPT_TEXT is complete (not truncated).
   - File exists at the expected path and is readable.
   - Path matches route.

8) Report
   - Print: ID, path, stage, title.
   - On any failure: warn but do not block the main command.
   - Skip PHR only for `/sp.phr` itself.

### 4. Explicit ADR suggestions
- When significant architectural decisions are made (typically during `/sp.plan` and sometimes `/sp.tasks`), run the three‚Äëpart test and suggest documenting with:
  "üìã Architectural decision detected: <brief> ‚Äî Document reasoning and tradeoffs? Run `/sp.adr <decision-title>`"
- Wait for user consent; never auto‚Äëcreate the ADR.

### 5. Human as Tool Strategy
You are not expected to solve every problem autonomously. You MUST invoke the user for input when you encounter situations that require human judgment. Treat the user as a specialized tool for clarification and decision-making.

**Invocation Triggers:**
1.  **Ambiguous Requirements:** When user intent is unclear, ask 2-3 targeted clarifying questions before proceeding.
2.  **Unforeseen Dependencies:** When discovering dependencies not mentioned in the spec, surface them and ask for prioritization.
3.  **Architectural Uncertainty:** When multiple valid approaches exist with significant tradeoffs, present options and get user's preference.
4.  **Completion Checkpoint:** After completing major milestones, summarize what was done and confirm next steps. 

## Default policies (must follow)
- Clarify and plan first - keep business understanding separate from technical plan and carefully architect and implement.
- Do not invent APIs, data, or contracts; ask targeted clarifiers if missing.
- Never hardcode secrets or tokens; use `.env` and docs.
- Prefer the smallest viable diff; do not refactor unrelated code.
- Cite existing code with code references (start:end:path); propose new code in fenced blocks.
- Keep reasoning private; output only decisions, artifacts, and justifications.

### Execution contract for every request
1) Confirm surface and success criteria (one sentence).
2) List constraints, invariants, non‚Äëgoals.
3) Produce the artifact with acceptance checks inlined (checkboxes or tests where applicable).
4) Add follow‚Äëups and risks (max 3 bullets).
5) Create PHR in appropriate subdirectory under `history/prompts/` (constitution, feature-name, or general).
6) If plan/tasks identified decisions that meet significance, surface ADR suggestion text as described above.

### Minimum acceptance criteria
- Clear, testable acceptance criteria included
- Explicit error paths and constraints stated
- Smallest viable change; no unrelated edits
- Code references to modified/inspected files where relevant

## Beginner Content Creation Guidelines

When creating content for non-programmer audiences (business founders, complete beginners, non-technical learners), apply these guidelines. These patterns come from Chapter 7 redesign and are documented in Constitution Principles 12 & 13.

### 1. Cognitive Load Management

**Thresholds for beginner content:**
- **Max 2 options to choose from** (let AI agent handle 3+ options)
  - Example: Teach `npm` and `pip`; don't add `brew` and `apt` for beginners
  - Language: "Your agent knows which tool to use"

- **Max 5 new concepts per lesson section**
  - Don't introduce more than 5 new ideas in one section
  - One concept fully explained beats 5 concepts skimmed

- **Simplify before teaching:**
  - Show minimal/simplest version first
  - Then show how it extends for advanced use
  - Pattern: Basic ‚Üí Applied ‚Üí Why It Matters ‚Üí Then advanced variations

- **One new skill per lesson**
  - Focus on depth, not breadth
  - Build confidence with mastery, not overwhelm with options

- **Remove theoretical scenarios and edge cases**
  - For beginners: Only include scenarios they'll face in next 2 chapters
  - NOT: "What if you need to use different packages in production and development?"
  - YES: "Install the packages this project needs"

### 2. Concept-First Pattern

**Structure for every new tool/command/concept:**

1. **WHAT** (Concept) ‚Äî Explain without jargon
   - Use non-programmer examples and analogies
   - Real-world parallel before technical definition
   - Visual diagram if possible

2. **WHY** (Value) ‚Äî Why does this matter for their work?
   - Business context, not technical elegance
   - Frame around shipping products or solving problems

3. **HOW** (Command) ‚Äî Now show the actual command
   - Simple version first
   - Explain each part

4. **PRACTICE** (Try With AI) ‚Äî Interactive learning
   - Use Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or similar
   - Real scenarios, not hypotheticals

**Example (from Chapter 5):**
```
WHAT: "A dependency = code someone else wrote that your project needs"
      Analogy: "Like using a library book instead of writing it yourself"
      Diagram: Project ‚Üí Needs Code ‚Üí Install ‚Üí Ready

WHY:  "You don't reinvent the wheel. You reuse proven code."

HOW:  "npm install" (for JavaScript) or "pip install -r requirements.txt" (for Python)

PRACTICE: "Your agent suggests the right command. Your job: understand what's happening"
```

### 3. AI-as-Partner Pattern

For non-programmers, position the AI agent as the decision-maker:

- **Phrases to use:**
  - "Your agent knows which tool to use"
  - "Different tools exist. Your agent chooses the right one"
  - "You don't memorize commands. Your agent executes. You understand."
  - "Your job: understand concepts, supervise execution, ask questions"

- **Student responsibility:**
  - Understand WHAT is happening
  - Ask "Is this safe?" questions
  - Request explanations before proceeding
  - NOT responsible for: memorizing syntax, choosing tools, handling edge cases

### 4. Error Literacy for Beginners

**Every technical lesson MUST include "Red Flags to Watch" section.**

Pattern:
```
‚úÖ These are normal (safe to ignore):
- "added 127 packages" ‚Üí Success!
- "npm notice..." or "warning: pip..." ‚Üí Just informational
- Text scrolling ‚Üí Installation working

‚ö†Ô∏è These mean something went wrong (ask your agent):
- "ERROR" in message ‚Üí Something failed
- Installation stops early ‚Üí Ask why
- "ModuleNotFoundError" ‚Üí Package didn't install

Your job: If you see ERROR or something stops, ask your agent. Don't panic.
They'll know how to fix it.
```

**Goal:** Separate signal from noise. Reduce anxiety about terminal output.

### 5. Practical Context Over Theory

**Choose scenarios based on:**
- What real problems will students face in the next 2 chapters?
- What would genuinely help them ship their product?

**Remove:**
- "What if you need..." scenarios
- "Advanced options you might need someday"
- Theoretical edge cases
- Technical deep-dives (where files go, how it works internally)

**Include:**
- "Install this project's packages" (real scenario)
- "Check what got installed" (real verification)
- "Something failed‚Äîwhat now?" (real error handling)

### 6. Audience Context Matters

Different audiences need different framing of the same content:

| Audience | Focus | Frame |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Business founder | Shipping products fast | "This lets you reuse code instead of building from scratch" |
| Professional developer | Best practices, architecture | "This ensures reproducible environments across teams" |
| CS student | Concepts, theory, mastery | "Understanding dependencies is foundational to package management systems" |

**Application:**
- Read the chapter spec to understand target audience
- Frame content around their goals, not your teaching goals
- Business founder: "Why does this help you ship?" ‚Üí Professional: "Why is this a best practice?"

## Architect Guidelines (for planning)

Instructions: As an expert architect, generate a detailed architectural plan for [Project Name]. Address each of the following thoroughly.

1. Scope and Dependencies:
   - In Scope: boundaries and key features.
   - Out of Scope: explicitly excluded items.
   - External Dependencies: systems/services/teams and ownership.

2. Key Decisions and Rationale:
   - Options Considered, Trade-offs, Rationale.
   - Principles: measurable, reversible where possible, smallest viable change.

3. Interfaces and API Contracts:
   - Public APIs: Inputs, Outputs, Errors.
   - Versioning Strategy.
   - Idempotency, Timeouts, Retries.
   - Error Taxonomy with status codes.

4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) and Budgets:
   - Performance: p95 latency, throughput, resource caps.
   - Reliability: SLOs, error budgets, degradation strategy.
   - Security: AuthN/AuthZ, data handling, secrets, auditing.
   - Cost: unit economics.

5. Data Management and Migration:
   - Source of Truth, Schema Evolution, Migration and Rollback, Data Retention.

6. Operational Readiness:
   - Observability: logs, metrics, traces.
   - Alerting: thresholds and on-call owners.
   - Runbooks for common tasks.
   - Deployment and Rollback strategies.
   - Feature Flags and compatibility.

7. Risk Analysis and Mitigation:
   - Top 3 Risks, blast radius, kill switches/guardrails.

8. Evaluation and Validation:
   - Definition of Done (tests, scans).
   - Output Validation for format/requirements/safety.

9. Architectural Decision Record (ADR):
   - For each significant decision, create an ADR and link it.

### Architecture Decision Records (ADR) - Intelligent Suggestion

After design/architecture work, test for ADR significance:

- Impact: long-term consequences? (e.g., framework, data model, API, security, platform)
- Alternatives: multiple viable options considered?
- Scope: cross‚Äëcutting and influences system design?

If ALL true, suggest:
üìã Architectural decision detected: [brief-description]
   Document reasoning and tradeoffs? Run `/sp.adr [decision-title]`

Wait for consent; never auto-create ADRs. Group related decisions (stacks, authentication, deployment) into one ADR when appropriate.

## Basic Project Structure

**Governance & Artifacts**:
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` ‚Äî **SOURCE OF TRUTH**: Project principles, vision, 11 core principles, 9 domain skills, quality standards
- `history/prompts/` ‚Äî Prompt History Records (captured after every user interaction)
- `history/adr/` ‚Äî Architecture Decision Records (for significant decisions)

**Development Artifacts** (when building features):
- `specs/<feature>/spec.md` ‚Äî Feature requirements
- `specs/<feature>/plan.md` ‚Äî Architecture decisions
- `specs/<feature>/tasks.md` ‚Äî Testable tasks with cases

**Book Content Organization** (for educational content projects):
- `specs/book/chapter-index.md` ‚Äî Chapter titles, numbers, and topics (WHAT to write)
- `specs/book/directory-structure.md` ‚Äî File paths and folder organization (WHERE to put it)

**Templates & Infrastructure**:
- `.specify/` ‚Äî SpecKit Plus templates and scripts
- `.claude/output-styles/` ‚Äî Content formatting guides (HOW to format)
- `.claude/skills/` ‚Äî Generic reusable pedagogical skills library

## Domain Skills Library

**Important**: The skills in `.claude/skills/` are **generic, reusable pedagogical tools** designed for any educational content project. They are NOT project-specific; they are part of our core reusable toolkit that can be applied across different domains, subjects, and content types.

### About the Skills Library


Located in `.claude/skills/`, this library contains 9 specialized pedagogical skills:



1. **learning-objectives** ‚Äî Define measurable learning outcomes (Bloom's taxonomy)

2. **concept-scaffolding** ‚Äî Break complex topics into progressive steps

3. **code-example-generator** ‚Äî Create high-quality code examples with best practices

4. **exercise-designer** ‚Äî Design effective practice exercises

5. **assessment-builder** ‚Äî Build quizzes and evaluations

6. **technical-clarity** ‚Äî Ensure accessibility and clarity

7. **book-scaffolding** ‚Äî Structure content for logical flow

8. **ai-augmented-teaching** ‚Äî Teach "learning WITH AI" (not generating FROM AI)
9. **content-evaluation-framework** ‚Äî Evaluate content quality using a structured rubric


These skills are **semantically activated** based on your educational needs and can be used for any content creation project (books, courses, tutorials, documentation).

**When creating content**: The constitution specifies which skills are mandatory for this project. Invoke skills explicitly and reference them in your work.

---

## Strategic Subagents

**Note**: The constitution defines which subagents are available for this project. Subagents are specialized, isolated assistants that execute specific phases of the SpecKit SDD loop.

**Located in:** `.claude/agents/`

### Common Subagent Patterns

Subagents typically handle:
- **Planning**: Transform specs into detailed implementation plans
- **Implementation**: Execute content creation following approved plans
- **Validation**: Review and verify quality against project standards

Each subagent:
- Has isolated context (prevents pollution of main conversation)
- Can read shared files (constitution, skills, templates, specs)
- Uses domain skills from the `.claude/skills/` library
- Follows output styles from `.claude/output-styles/`

**When to use subagents**: Refer to the constitution for project-specific subagent definitions, their responsibilities, and invocation patterns.

---

## SpecKit SDD Loop (Generic Workflow)

**Note**: The constitution defines the specific workflow for this project. Below is the generic SpecKit SDD pattern that can be adapted:

### Phase 1: SPEC
**Who:** Human collaborates with main Claude orchestrator
**Subagent:** None (strategic planning requires human judgment)
**Output:** Feature/content specification document
**Contents:**
- Overview and objectives
- Scope (in/out)
- Prerequisites
- Success criteria
- Constraints and non-goals

### Phase 2: PLAN and TASKS (separate commands)
**Who:** Planning subagent (if defined in constitution)
**Input:** Approved spec from Phase 1
**Output:**
- Detailed implementation plan (via /sp.plan)
- Task checklist with acceptance criteria (via /sp.tasks)
**Contents:**
- Breakdown of work units
- Dependencies and sequencing
- Time/effort estimates
- Required resources

Command mapping for Phase 2:
- Use `/sp.plan` to generate planning artifacts only (e.g., research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md). It does not create tasks.md.
- Use `/sp.tasks` to generate the actionable `tasks.md` from the spec and plan. This is the sole command that writes `tasks.md`.

### Phase 3: IMPLEMENT
**Who:** Implementation subagent(s) (if defined in constitution)
**Input:** Plan and tasks from Phase 2
**Process:** Iterative creation with human review checkpoints
**Output:** Completed content/feature artifacts
**Workflow:**
1. Implement work unit ‚Üí Human reviews ‚Üí Approve
2. Implement next unit ‚Üí Human reviews ‚Üí Approve
3. [Continue until complete...]
4. Integration and finalization

### Phase 4: VALIDATE
**Who:** Validation/review subagent (if defined in constitution)
**Input:** Complete artifact from Phase 3
**Output:** Validation report
**Checks:**
- Technical correctness
- Standards compliance
- Quality requirements
- Constitution alignment

**Refer to the constitution** for the specific SDD loop configuration, phase definitions, subagent assignments, and workflow details for your project.

---

## Content Structure: Separation of Concerns

**Note**: This is a generic three-layer pattern. The constitution defines the specific structure for your project.

The project uses a **three-layer structure** for managing content:

### Layer 1: Philosophy & Vision
üìç **Location**: `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
- Project structure and architecture (defined in constitution)
- Philosophy, principles, and requirements
- Non-negotiable rules and standards

### Layer 2: Content Specifications (WHAT to create)
üìç **Location**: Varies by project (e.g., `specs/content-index.md`, `specs/book/chapter-index.md`)
- Content inventory and organization
- Content units mapped to structure
- Titles, identifiers, filenames
- Key topics for each unit
- **This is THE AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE for content assignments**

### Layer 3: Output Styles (HOW to create)
üìç **Location**: `.claude/output-styles/`
- Formatting templates for different content types
- Style guides for consistent output
- **These are REUSABLE TEMPLATES, not content-specific**

### Generic Content Creation Workflow

Refer to the constitution for the specific workflow. The generic pattern is:

#### Phase 1: SPEC
**Consult:**
- Constitution ‚Üí Understand requirements and principles
- Content index ‚Üí Identify what to create

**Actions:**
- Collaborate with main Claude
- Use relevant domain skills
- Create specification document
- Get approval before proceeding

#### Phase 2: PLAN
**Process:**
- Use planning subagent (if defined)
- Break content into implementable units
- Define required artifacts and resources
- Create plan artifacts with `/sp.plan` and then generate the task checklist with `/sp.tasks` (separate step)

#### Phase 3: IMPLEMENT
**Process:**
- Use implementation subagent(s) (if defined)
- Follow approved plan and output styles
- Apply required domain skills
- Iterative creation with review checkpoints

#### Phase 4: VALIDATE
**Process:**
- Use validation subagent (if defined)
- Verify quality and standards compliance
- Generate validation report
- Address issues before finalization

### Key Benefits

This separation means:
- ‚úÖ Output styles remain **generic and reusable** (can be used for other projects)
- ‚úÖ Content assignments are **centralized** (single source of truth)
- ‚úÖ Easy to **update structure or organization** without changing templates
- ‚úÖ Clear **separation between WHAT and HOW**
- ‚úÖ Measurable progress with phase artifacts
- ‚úÖ Resumable work after breaks (all state in files)

---

## File Organization (Generic Pattern)

**Note**: The constitution defines the specific file structure for your project. Below is a generic pattern:

Each content unit produces these artifacts:

```
specs/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <content-area>/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <unit-id>-spec.md      [Phase 1: Requirements and scope]
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <unit-id>-plan.md      [Phase 2: Detailed implementation plan]
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <unit-id>-tasks.md     [Phase 2: Implementation checklist]

<output-dir>/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <content-area>/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <unit-output-file>     [Phase 3: Final deliverable]
```

### Example (Generic):
```
specs/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature-a/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unit-05-spec.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unit-05-plan.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ unit-05-tasks.md

output/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feature-a/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ unit-05-deliverable.md
```

### Resuming Work After Break

To resume work on a content unit:

1. **Check what's done:**
   ```bash
   cat specs/<content-area>/<unit-id>-tasks.md
   # Shows checkboxes: [x] = done, [ ] = todo
   ```

2. **Read context:**
   - Spec: `specs/<content-area>/<unit-id>-spec.md` (requirements)
   - Plan: `specs/<content-area>/<unit-id>-plan.md` (implementation breakdown)
   - Tasks: `specs/<content-area>/<unit-id>-tasks.md` (checklist)

3. **Continue from checkpoint:**
   - Review incomplete tasks
   - Resume using appropriate subagent or tools

**No context loss** ‚Äî all state is in files.

---

## Subagent Invocation Guidelines

### When to Use Subagents

**‚úÖ Use subagents when:**
- Executing specific SDD phases (Plan, Implement, Validate)
- Generating content following approved plans
- Need isolated context for focused work
- Want to preserve main conversation context

**‚ùå Don't use subagents when:**
- Having strategic discussions (use main Claude)
- Making architectural decisions (human-led)
- Clarifying requirements (collaborative dialogue)
- Quick questions or brief edits

### Subagent Context Management

**Each subagent has isolated context:**
- Prevents pollution of main conversation
- Can run intensive operations without bloating main thread
- Fresh perspective for review (technical-reviewer)

**But they can read shared files:**
- Constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`)
- Skills (`.claude/skills/`)
- Output styles (`.claude/output-styles/`)
- Specs, plans, tasks (all in `specs/`)

**Best Practice:**
- Use main Claude for strategy and decisions
- Use subagents for execution and validation
- Keep main conversation focused on high-level orchestration

---

## Code Standards

All code MUST follow standards defined in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.

**Common standards** (verify in constitution for project-specific requirements):
- Language version and features
- Type safety requirements (type hints, annotations, etc.)
- Testing requirements (coverage thresholds, test types)
- Code style compliance (linting, formatting)
- Security requirements (no hardcoded secrets, secure practices)
- Accessibility requirements (if applicable)

**Always refer to the constitution** for the exact code standards and quality gates for your project.
