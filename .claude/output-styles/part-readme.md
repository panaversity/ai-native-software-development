## Critical Rules for Part READMEs

### 1. **Narrative, Not Specification**
- ❌ NEVER: "Purpose: Gain hands-on experience with..."
- ✅ ALWAYS: "Picture this: You've just finished Part 1..."
- Part READMEs tell a story; they don't list features

### 2. **Opening Hook (Required)**
- Must start with a concrete scenario, story, or thought-provoking question
- Should NOT be an abstract overview
- 2-3 paragraphs minimum
- Examples:
  - Part 1: "A solo developer in Seattle launches a financial analysis tool..."
  - Part 2: "You open your terminal... and you're staring at a blank screen..."

### 3. **Audience Segmentation (Required)**
- Use **bold subheadings** for distinct personas
- Each persona gets 1-2 sentences explaining how this part serves them
- Include 4-5 different audience types when possible
- Examples: "If you're a complete beginner...", "If you're an experienced developer...", "If you're skeptical..."

### 4. **Chapter Descriptions (Not Lists)**
- ✅ Each chapter as H3 subheading with narrative description
- ✅ Include estimated time clearly
- ✅ 1-2 paragraphs of context/why it matters (not just topics)
- ✅ Bulleted accomplishments with checkmarks
- ❌ NEVER: Simple bullet lists of topics

### 5. **"What You Won't Learn (Yet)" (Required)**
- Establishes clear boundaries
- Explains what IS included and why
- Example: "This part is hands-on and operational, not theoretical"

### 6. **"How to Read This Part" (Required)**
- Provides SPECIFIC guidance for this part's type
- Different guidance for conceptual vs. technical vs. practical parts
- Use bold subheadings for each strategy
- Examples:
  - Conceptual: "Take your time... Pause and think..."
  - Technical: "Follow along... Make mistakes safely..."
  - Hands-on: "Expect confusion... Use AI tools..."

### 7. **Mindset Section (Required)**
- Addresses psychological/philosophical dimension
- NOT just content overview
- Discusses perspective shifts, common misconceptions, or learning approach
- Concrete examples, not abstract philosophy

### 8. **Consistent Tone**
- Engaging, conversational, reader-focused
- Use "you" and "your" throughout
- Active voice
- Professional yet approachable
- Same tone as lesson.md output style

### 9. **Prerequisites Section (Required)**
- Use checkmarks and X marks for visual clarity
- Separate "absolutely need" from "don't need"
- Include special notes (platform requirements, accounts, corporate considerations)

### 10. **Closing "Ready?" Section (Required)**
- Creates momentum and emotional engagement
- Summarizes transformation that will occur
- Concrete statement of what becomes possible
- Final call-to-action

### 11. **Footer Chapter List (Required)**
- List all chapters with their titles
- Use markdown link format: `[Chapter N: Title](#)`
- Helps with navigation and gives overview

## Content Enrichment Patterns (Apply These Throughout)

See lesson.md for detailed patterns, but for Parts:

1. **Rich Storytelling**: Include 3-5 concrete examples throughout (not just opening)
2. **Historical Context**: Reference precedents or patterns (2-3 comparisons)
3. **Personal Relevance**: Show how content applies to reader's specific situation
4. **Honest Assessment**: Address doubts proactively with evidence
5. **Forward Momentum**: Strong transitions showing how parts connect

---

## Examples of Strong Opening Hooks

### ✅ Part 1 (Conceptual)
> "Picture this: A solo developer in Seattle launches a financial analysis tool specifically for small accounting firms. Within 18 months, the application serves 50,000 users and generates $12 million in annual revenue..."

### ✅ Part 2 (Hands-on)
> "You open your terminal (or maybe you've never opened one before), and you're staring at a blank screen. You've heard about Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and GitHub. You know they're powerful. You have no idea where to start..."

### ❌ Weak Opening
> "Purpose: Become proficient with the AI development tools..."

### ❌ Weak Opening
> "Overview: This part introduces..."

---

## Examples of Strong Chapter Descriptions

### ✅ Narrative with Purpose
> "You'll install and configure Claude Code, understanding why this 'simple' command-line interface triggered such rapid adoption. We explore the origin story (how an internal Anthropic tool became a public phenomenon), walk through installation on Windows, Mac, and Linux, and demonstrate Claude Code's unique architecture..."

### ❌ List-Based
> "- Installation steps
> - Subagents
> - Agent skills
> - MCP servers"
