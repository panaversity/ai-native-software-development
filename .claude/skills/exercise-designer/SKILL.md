  Designs deliberate practice exercises applying evidence-based learning strategies like retrieval
  practice, spaced repetition, and interleaving. Activate when educators need varied exercise types
  (fill-in-blank, debug-this, build-from-scratch, extend-code) targeting learning objectives with
  appropriate difficulty progression. Creates exercise sets that apply cognitive science principles
  to maximize retention and skill development. Use when designing practice activities for Python

## Purpose

The exercise-designer skill helps educators create varied, evidence-based practice exercises that target specific learning objectives and apply proven strategies from cognitive science. This skill designs exercises with appropriate difficulty progression, spaced repetition opportunities, and clear assessment criteria.

## When to Activate

Use this skill when:
- Educators need practice exercises for Python concepts
- Designing homework assignments or problem sets
- Creating varied exercise types beyond simple coding problems
- Applying evidence-based learning strategies (retrieval practice, spaced repetition)
- Establishing difficulty progression across exercise sequences
- Generating test cases and rubrics for exercises
- Evaluating existing exercises for pedagogical effectiveness

## Inputs

Required:
- **Learning objectives**: What learners should be able to do
- **Concept/topic**: Python concept to practice (e.g., "loops", "dictionaries")

Optional:
- **Target audience**: beginner | intermediate | advanced
- **Number of exercises**: How many to generate
- **Exercise types**: Preferred types (fill-in, debug, build-from-scratch, etc.)
- **Time constraints**: Total time available for exercises
- **Prior concepts**: Previously learned concepts for spaced repetition

## Process

### Step 1: Clarify Learning Objectives

Understand what learners should achieve:
- Specific skills to demonstrate
- Depth of understanding required (recall vs. application vs. creation)
- Connection to Bloom's taxonomy levels

### Step 2: Load Exercise Type Reference

Read exercise type patterns for variety:

```bash
Read reference/exercise-types.md
```

Available types:
- **Fill-in-the-blank**: Focus on specific concepts with scaffolding
- **Debug-this**: Develop error recognition skills
- **Build-from-scratch**: Test independent problem-solving
- **Extend-the-code**: Practice incremental development
- **Trace-execution**: Test mental execution model
- **Explain-code**: Promote deeper understanding
- **Refactor**: Teach code quality and Pythonic patterns
- **Parsons problems**: Focus on logic flow

### Step 3: Load Evidence-Based Strategies

Read cognitive science strategies to apply:

```bash
Read reference/evidence-based-strategies.md
```

Key strategies:
- **Retrieval Practice**: Recall from memory strengthens learning
- **Spaced Repetition**: Distribute practice over time
- **Interleaving**: Mix exercise types and concepts
- **Elaboration**: Ask "why" and "how" questions
- **Desirable Difficulty**: Appropriate challenge level

### Step 4: Design Exercise Variety

Create 3-5 exercises using multiple types:

**Mix Exercise Types** (avoid 5 identical exercises):
```
Exercise 1: Fill-in-blank (quick warm-up)
Exercise 2: Debug-this (error recognition)
Exercise 3: Build-from-scratch (application)
Exercise 4: Explain-code (elaboration)
Exercise 5: Extend-code (integration)
```

**Apply Interleaving**: Mix new and prior concepts:
- 60% current concept
- 30% recent concepts (last 1-2 lessons)
- 10% older concepts (3+ lessons ago)

### Step 5: Establish Difficulty Progression

Load difficulty progression guide:

```bash
Read reference/difficulty-progression.md
```

Sequence exercises from easier to harder:
- **Easy**: High scaffolding, clear structure
- **Medium**: Moderate scaffolding, specification-based
- **Hard**: Minimal scaffolding, open-ended

**Bloom's Progression**:
1. Remember/Understand (trace execution, explain)
2. Apply (fill-in-blank, standard problems)
3. Analyze (debug-this, compare approaches)
4. Evaluate/Create (build-from-scratch, refactor)

### Step 6: Incorporate Spaced Repetition

Load spaced repetition patterns:

```bash
Read reference/spaced-repetition.md
```

Include prior concepts for review:
- Identify concepts from previous lessons
- Design exercises combining old + new concepts
- Tag exercises with concepts practiced (for tracking)

**Example**:
```
Lesson 5 (Current: Loops)
Exercise 1: Loop basics (new)
Exercise 2: Loops + lists (review Lesson 2)
Exercise 3: Loops + conditionals (review Lesson 3)
Exercise 4: Loops + functions (review Lesson 4)
```

### Step 7: Create Test Cases

Generate comprehensive test cases:

```bash
Read templates/exercise-template.yml
```

Include:
- **Normal cases**: Typical usage (60%)
- **Edge cases**: Empty inputs, boundaries, special cases (30%)
- **Error cases**: Invalid inputs, exceptions (10%)

Validate test coverage using script:

```bash
python .claude/skills/exercise-designer/scripts/generate-test-cases.py exercise.yml
```

The script will:
- Analyze existing test case coverage
- Suggest missing test types
- Provide concept-specific recommendations
- Check for normal/edge/error case balance

### Step 8: Define Assessment Rubric

Load rubric template:

```bash
Read templates/rubric-template.yml
```

Create rubric with criteria:
- **Correctness** (40%): Produces correct output
- **Code Quality** (30%): Readable, well-structured
- **Efficiency** (20%): Appropriate approach
- **Error Handling** (10%): Edge case consideration

Each criterion has levels: excellent, adequate, developing, insufficient

### Step 9: Add Progressive Hints

Provide 3 levels of hints:
- **Level 1** (gentle): Direction without giving answer
- **Level 2** (moderate): More specific guidance
- **Level 3** (explicit): Nearly complete solution

**Example**:
```
Exercise: Write function to find duplicates in a list

Hint 1: "Consider using a set to track items you've seen"
Hint 2: "Iterate through list, add items to set, check if item already in set"
Hint 3: "Use: seen = set(); for item in list: if item in seen..."
```

### Step 10: Validate and Refine

- [ ] Clear learning objective stated
- [ ] Appropriate difficulty for target audience
- [ ] Complete instructions (learner knows what to do)
- [ ] Test cases provided (normal + edge + error)
- [ ] At least 2 evidence-based strategies applied
- [ ] Exercise is achievable in estimated time
- [ ] Rubric or evaluation criteria included

**Input**: "Create 5 exercises for practicing list methods (append, remove, extend) for beginners"

**Process**:
1. Identify learning objectives: Use list methods correctly, understand when to use each
2. Choose variety: fill-in-blank, debug-this, build-from-scratch, explain-code, trace-execution
3. Progress difficulty: easy → medium → medium → hard → medium
4. Apply strategies: retrieval practice (no references), interleaving (mix method types)
5. Add test cases and rubrics
6. Include hints

**Output**: 5-exercise set with variety, progression, test cases, and strategies applied

### Example 2: Review Existing Exercise Set

**Input**: "Evaluate these 10 loop exercises for pedagogical effectiveness"

**Process**:
1. Check variety: "All 10 are build-from-scratch—needs more variety"
2. Check progression: "Difficulty jumps too quickly from exercise 2 to 3"
3. Check strategies: "No spaced repetition—all exercises only use loops, no prior concepts"
4. Check test cases: "Only 3 exercises have test cases, edge cases missing"
5. Provide specific recommendations

**Output**: Detailed assessment with actionable improvements

### Example 3: Design Exercises with Spaced Repetition

**Input**: "Create exercises for dictionaries (Lesson 4) that review lists (Lesson 2) and conditionals (Lesson 3)"

**Process**:
1. Primary concept: Dictionary methods and operations
2. Secondary concepts: Lists, conditionals (for review)
3. Design exercises combining concepts:
   - Exercise 1: Dictionary basics (new)
   - Exercise 2: Dictionary + conditionals (review)
   - Exercise 3: Dictionary + lists (review)
   - Exercise 4: All three combined
4. Tag for tracking: primary=dictionaries, secondary=[lists, conditionals]

**Output**: Exercise set with explicit spaced repetition

## Error Handling

If validation fails:
1. Report specific issues (e.g., "All exercises are same type", "No test cases provided")
2. Suggest remediation (e.g., "Add debug-this and trace-execution exercises")
3. Halt and require user intervention (hard failure mode)

Examples must meet quality standards: varied types, appropriate difficulty, clear objectives, comprehensive test cases.
