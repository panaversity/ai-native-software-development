## Key Concepts

### College-Level Conceptual Questions

**Shift from Recall to Understanding:**

‚ùå **Recall (Avoid):**
> "What is a Python list?" ‚Üí Tests memorization

‚úÖ **Conceptual (Target):**
> "Given this code with list operations, what misconception does this error reveal?" ‚Üí Tests understanding

**Why College-Level?**
1. Job readiness: Professional developers need to understand WHY, not just WHAT
2. AI-era skills: With AI generating code, understanding concepts matters more than syntax recall
3. Transfer learning: Conceptual knowledge transfers; memorized facts don't
4. Better assessment: Conceptual questions predict programming competence

**Cognitive Level Target:**
- 75%+ questions at Apply level or higher
- Focus on debugging, prediction, analysis (not recall)

---

### Quiz Component Architecture

**Built-in Features (No Manual Implementation Needed):**
- ‚úÖ Progress bar showing completion percentage
- ‚úÖ Question navigation (Back/Next buttons + number dots)
- ‚úÖ Answer counter (X/Y answered)
- ‚úÖ Validation: Can't submit until all answered
- ‚úÖ Results page with score and review option
- ‚úÖ Color-coded feedback (green = correct, red = incorrect)
- ‚úÖ Instant explanations shown after submission
- ‚úÖ Retake button to try again
- ‚úÖ Light/Dark theme auto-switching
- ‚úÖ Fully responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)

**Why Fewer Questions (5-10)?**
- Quiz component excels at interactive, focused assessments
- 5-10 questions allows deeper explanations and engagement
- Mobile-friendly (scrolling 20+ questions frustrates users)
- Better learning outcomes: focused questions > quantity
- Matches pedagogical best practices (Bloom's taxonomy levels)

---

### Answer Randomization with Quiz Component

**Requirements:**
- Correct answers distributed across 0-3 indices (not a/b/c/d)
- For 8 questions: ~2 per index (25% each)
- No obvious patterns
- Maximum 2 consecutive same answers

**Quiz Component Format:**
```javascript
{
  question: "Your question?",
  options: ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
  correctOption: 2,  // Index 0-3, NOT 1-4!
  explanation: "Why this is correct..."
}
```

**How to Randomize:**
1. Write questions first (don't worry about position)
2. After ALL questions written, shuffle correctOption values
3. Verify distribution is roughly equal
4. Ensure no 3+ consecutive same answers

üìñ **Reference:** [answer-distribution.md](./references/answer-distribution.md) for verification methods

---

### Explanation Quality (Critical)

**Quiz component shows explanations immediately after submission.** This enables deeper learning than traditional quizzes:

**Good Explanations (60-150 words):**
1. **Explain WHY correct** (2-3 sentences)
2. **Address why distractors wrong** (1-2 sentences each)
3. **Add context/examples** (connections, real-world usage)

**Example:**
```javascript
explanation: "Lists are mutable (changeable) in Python, so append() modifies the original list.
This is different from strings, which are immutable‚Äîyou can't change them after creation.
The add() method doesn't exist in Python (that's Java), insert() requires a position,
and push() is JavaScript. Understanding mutability is crucial for debugging variable scope issues."
```

## Quiz Architecture

### Fixed Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

```yaml
question_count: 20-30  # Comprehensive assessment (20-30 questions)
options_per_question: 4  # Always exactly 4 options
option_length: EQUAL  # ¬±2 words maximum difference (CRITICAL to prevent length guessing)
question_format: multiple_choice  # Only MCQ
correct_answer_distribution: random_equal  # indices 0-3 equally distributed
passing_score: 70  # 70% (14/20 or 21/30)
file_naming: ##_chapter_##_quiz.md  # e.g., 05_chapter_02_quiz.md
output_format: Markdown with Quiz component  # <Quiz {...} /> (globally registered)
component_globally_registered: true  # No imports needed
```

**CRITICAL ANTI-PATTERNS:**
- ‚ùå **LENGTH-BASED GUESSING: Options with different lengths** (e.g., 5 words vs 20 words)
  - Students can guess by selecting longest/shortest option
  - ALL options MUST be ¬±2 words maximum difference
  - MANUALLY VERIFY word count for every option
- ‚ùå Using array indices 1-4 (use 0-3!)
- ‚ùå Questions that test recall instead of understanding
- ‚ùå Explanations without addressing why distractors are wrong
- ‚ùå No randomization of correctOption values
- ‚ùå Fewer than 20 or more than 30 questions
- ‚ùå File naming like `##_quiz.md` (use `##_chapter_##_quiz.md`)

---

### File Structure

```markdown
---
sidebar_position: X  # e.g., 06 (lessons + 1)
title: "Chapter X: [Topic] Quiz"
---

# Chapter X: [Topic] Quiz

Brief introduction about what students should test (1-2 sentences).

<Quiz
  title="Chapter X: [Topic] Assessment"
  questions={[
    {
      question: "Question 1 text here?",
      options: [
        "Option A",
        "Option B",
        "Option C (correct)",
        "Option D"
      ],
      correctOption: 2,  // Index 0-3
      explanation: "Comprehensive explanation (60-150 words) explaining why correct,
        addressing why distractors are wrong, and providing additional context."
    },
    {
      question: "Question 2 text?",
      options: ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
      correctOption: 0,
      explanation: "..."
    }
    // ... 6-8 more questions
  ]}
  passingScore={70}
/>
```

**Key Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ Exactly 4 options per question (no more, no less)
- ‚úÖ `correctOption` uses 0-3 index (NOT 1-4)
- ‚úÖ Explanations address why each distractor is wrong
- ‚úÖ No imports needed for `<Quiz />` (globally registered)

## Common Pitfalls (Top 6)

1. **LENGTH-BASED GUESSING (CRITICAL):** Options with wildly different lengths
   - ‚ùå Option A: 5 words | Option B: 15 words | Option C: 8 words | Option D: 6 words
   - ‚ùå Students guess longest option and score 95% by guessing
   - ‚úÖ Option A: 10 words | Option B: 9 words | Option C: 11 words | Option D: 10 words (¬±2 words)
   - Fix: **MANUALLY COUNT WORDS for every option. Make all ¬±2 words maximum difference.**

2. **Index Confusion (CRITICAL):** Using correctOption: 1-4 instead of 0-3
   - ‚ùå `correctOption: 4` ‚Üí References non-existent 5th option
   - ‚úÖ `correctOption: 3` ‚Üí Correct (last option, 4th item)
   - Fix: Always use 0-3 indices

3. **Testing Recall:** "What is X?" questions ‚Üí Memorization
   - ‚ùå "What is a Python list?"
   - ‚úÖ "Which operation modifies a list in-place?"
   - Fix: Focus on Apply/Analyze/Evaluate levels

4. **Weak Distractors:** Options that are obviously wrong
   - ‚ùå "Which is correct?" with options including "banana" or "xyz"
   - ‚úÖ "Which is correct?" where all options are plausible misconceptions
   - Fix: Every distractor should test a specific misconception

5. **Missing Explanation Details:** Not addressing why distractors are wrong
   - ‚ùå "Lists are mutable." (only explains correct answer)
   - ‚úÖ "Lists are mutable; strings aren't. The append() method exists, but add() doesn't (that's Java)..." (explains all options)
   - Fix: Address each distractor explicitly

6. **Answer Patterns:** Obvious distribution patterns in correctOption
   - ‚ùå correctOption sequence: 0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3... (repeating pattern)
   - ‚úÖ correctOption sequence: 2,0,1,3,1,0,2,1... (random distribution)
   - Fix: Shuffle after writing; verify no patterns

## File Naming Convention

### Pattern: `##_chapter_##_quiz.md`

Where:
- First `##` = sidebar_position (lesson count + 1)
- Second `##` = chapter number (zero-padded)
- Extension: `.md` (Quiz component is globally registered, no imports needed)

**Examples:**
- Chapter 2 (4 lessons): `05_chapter_02_quiz.md`
- Chapter 5 (6 lessons): `07_chapter_05_quiz.md`
- Chapter 14 (5 lessons): `06_chapter_14_quiz.md`

**Why this naming:**
- Matches lesson naming convention
- Clear chapter identification
- `.md` extension (Quiz component handles JSX rendering)
- Natural sorting places quiz at chapter end
