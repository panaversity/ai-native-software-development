## Stage 1: Analyze Chapter Structure

**Goal:** Understand chapter scope, identify all lessons, and map key concepts.

**Process:**

1. **Read chapter content:**
   - Examine book-source/docs/[chapter-path]/ directory
   - List all lesson files (lesson-1.md, lesson-2.md, etc.)

2. **Identify lessons:**
   - Note key concepts taught in each lesson
   - Identify prerequisite chapters referenced
   - Map which concepts are foundational vs. advanced

3. **Extract learning objectives:**
   - What can students do after this chapter?
   - What concepts are foundational vs. advanced?
   - What common mistakes are mentioned?

**Artifacts:**
- Chapter outline with lessons
- Concept map (which lessons teach what)
- Learning objectives list
- Common mistakes inventory

---

## Stage 2: Map Concepts to Question Distribution

**Goal:** Achieve comprehensive coverage of all chapter material with fair weighting across lessons.

**Distribution Strategy:**

For a chapter with N lessons and target of Q questions (20-30):
- **Base allocation:** Q ÷ N questions per lesson (rounded)
- **Adjust for importance:** +1 for complex/critical lessons
- **Adjust for length/depth:** +1 for longer lessons with more content
- **Final balance:** Sum to Q questions (within 20-30 range)
- **Comprehensive coverage:** Ensure ALL major topics and lessons are represented (no omissions)

**Cognitive Level Distribution (College Standard):**

Target:
- **Remember:** 0-2 questions (0-8%) - Minimal recall
- **Understand:** 5-7 questions (20-28%) - Concept grasp
- **Apply:** 10-15 questions (40-50%) - Use in context
- **Analyze:** 5-8 questions (20-28%) - Debug, compare, diagnose
- **Evaluate:** 1-2 questions (4-8%) - Judge quality, tradeoffs
- **Create:** 0-1 questions (0-4%) - Design solutions

**Requirement:** 75%+ questions at Apply level or higher (college standard)
**Flexibility:** Use 20-30 questions as needed for comprehensive coverage (not rigid 25)

---

## Stage 3: Generate 20-30 Conceptual Questions (Comprehensive Coverage)

**Goal:** Write questions testing understanding, not memorization.

**Question Quality Criteria:**

✅ **Good Conceptual Questions:**
- Require understanding WHY, not just WHAT
- Present realistic code scenarios
- Test debugging or prediction skills
- Ask about tradeoffs or best practices
- Require analysis of behavior
- Connect multiple concepts

❌ **Poor Recall Questions:**
- "What is a Python list?" (definition)
- "Which file stores configuration?" (memorization)
- "What is OAuth?" (terminology)
- "List three CLI commands" (recall)

**Writing Process:**

For each question:
1. **Identify concept:** What specific understanding to test?
2. **Choose scenario:** Realistic context for the concept
3. **Write question:** Clear, specific, unambiguous
4. **Determine correct answer:** The one demonstrating understanding
5. **Draft distractors:** Based on common misconceptions
6. **Write explanation:** Why correct, why distractors wrong

---

## Stage 4: Design Meaningful Distractors with Equal/Random Option Lengths

**Goal:** Create plausible wrong answers that diagnose specific misconceptions WITHOUT allowing guessing based on option length.

**Distractor Design Philosophy:**

Distractors should:
- **Test specific misconceptions** (not random wrong answers)
- **Be plausible** (student with partial knowledge might choose them)
- **Diagnose thinking errors** (reveal what student misunderstands)
- **Avoid obvious incorrectness** (no joke options)
- **CRITICAL: Match option length strategy** (equal length or randomly varied)

**Distractor Sources:**

1. **Common Student Errors:** Check chapter's "Common Mistakes" section
2. **Partial Understanding:** Mixing up related but distinct concepts
3. **Opposite Logic:** Inverse of correct answer
4. **Off-by-One Errors:** Close to correct but subtly wrong

**Key Principle:** Every distractor must have PURPOSE — it tests a specific misconception. Option length must NOT be a clue. See [option-length-strategy.md](./option-length-strategy.md) for detailed implementation.

---

## Stage 5: Randomize Correct Answers Across A/B/C/D

**Goal:** Eliminate answer patterns and prevent test-taking strategies like "always choose longest" or "always C."

**Requirements:**

- **No patterns:** Correct answer must appear randomly (not A, B, C, D, A, B, C, D...)
- **Equal distribution:** Each option (a/b/c/d) correct roughly equal times
- **No runs:** Avoid 3+ consecutive same answer positions
- **True randomness:** Shuffle answer positions after writing questions (then verify distribution)

**Distribution Targets:**

For 20 questions:
```
Option a correct: 5 times (25%)
Option b correct: 5 times (25%)
Option c correct: 5 times (25%)
Option d correct: 5 times (25%)
Max consecutive same: 2
```

For 25 questions:
```
Option a correct: 6-7 times (24-28%)
Option b correct: 6-7 times (24-28%)
Option c correct: 6-7 times (24-28%)
Option d correct: 5-6 times (20-24%)
Max consecutive same: 2
```

For 30 questions:
```
Option a correct: 7-8 times (23-27%)
Option b correct: 7-8 times (23-27%)
Option c correct: 7-8 times (23-27%)
Option d correct: 7-8 times (23-27%)
Max consecutive same: 2
```

**How to Randomize:**
1. Write all questions with correct answer in any position (don't overthink it)
2. After writing ALL questions, identify which position is correct for each
3. Shuffle the answer positions (move correct answer randomly to a/b/c/d)
4. Verify distribution is roughly equal
5. Ensure no 3+ consecutive same answers
6. Document the randomization in answer key section

See [answer-distribution.md](./answer-distribution.md) for verification methods.

## Stage 6: Write Comprehensive Explanations for Answer Key

**Goal:** Provide learning value through detailed answer explanations (shown only AFTER quiz, in answer key section).

**Explanation Requirements (Answer Key Only):**

Every explanation must:
1. **Confirm correct answer clearly** with single letter (a/b/c/d)
2. **Explain WHY it's correct** - 2-3 sentences explaining the concept deeply
3. **Address why distractors are wrong** - 1-2 sentences each for major misconceptions
4. **Provide additional context** - Reference lesson, provide examples, extend learning

**Explanation Template:**

```
**Q[number].** Correct answer: [a/b/c/d]

[Why this is correct - 2-3 sentences explaining the concept and reasoning]

[Why option [X] is wrong - 1 sentence per key distractor - 3-4 sentences total]

[Additional insight, connection to other lessons, or real-world application - 1-2 sentences]
```

**Explanation Length and Depth:**
- **Minimum:** 60 words (comprehensive teaching)
- **Target:** 80-120 words (thorough, educational)
- **Maximum:** 150 words (avoid overwhelming, but depth matters more than brevity)
- Explanations are shown AFTER students complete quiz, so length doesn't affect assessment time

**Critical Difference from v1.0:**
- v1.0 had inline explanations with Quiz component (defeated assessment purpose)
- v2.0 uses answer key section AFTER quiz (allows true independent assessment)
- Explanations should be MORE detailed now (not rushed due to component constraints)

---

## Stage 7: Format as MDX with Questions + Answer Key

**Goal:** Create valid MDX file with two-part structure: questions section (no answers) + answer key section.

**File Structure:**

```mdx
---
title: "Chapter X: [Topic] Quiz"
description: "College-level assessment covering all material from Chapter X"
---
