## Key Changes

### 1. **Scope Change: 20-30 → 5-10 Questions**
- **Why:** Quiz component optimized for focused, interactive assessments
- **Benefit:** Better UX, deeper explanations, higher engagement, better learning outcomes
- **Pedagogical:** Aligned with Bloom's taxonomy (depth > breadth)

### 2. **File Format: .md (No .mdx Extension)**
- **How:** Quiz component is globally registered—no imports needed
- **Format:** Standard markdown files with JSX component
- **Advantage:** Simplicity, compatibility with existing Docusaurus setup

### 3. **Answer Format: Indices 0-3 (Not a/b/c/d)**
- **Old:** correctAnswer: "a", "b", "c", or "d" (strings)
- **New:** correctOption: 0, 1, 2, or 3 (numeric indices)
- **Reason:** JavaScript array indexing, proper component integration

### 4. **Instant Feedback Instead of Answer Key**
- **Old:** Answer key at end of quiz (two-part format)
- **New:** Explanations shown immediately after answer submission
- **Benefit:** Real-time learning, instant reinforcement, deeper explanations possible

### 5. **Component-Driven Features (Built-in, No Manual Work)**
The Quiz component automatically provides:
- ✅ Progress bar

## Critical Implementation Details

### Index Values Must Be 0-3

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG
correctOption: "a"  // String, uses letters
correctOption: 1    // Using 1-4 instead of 0-3

// ✅ CORRECT
correctOption: 0    // First option (index 0)
correctOption: 3    // Fourth option (index 3)
```

### Exactly 4 Options Per Question

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG
options: ["A", "B", "C"]           // Only 3 options
options: ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"] // 5 options

// ✅ CORRECT
options: ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"]  // Exactly 4
```

### Comprehensive Explanations for All Distractors

```javascript
// ❌ WEAK
explanation: "Lists are mutable."  // Only explains correct

// ✅ STRONG
explanation: "Lists are mutable, so append() modifies in place.
Strings are immutable (different behavior). The extend() method adds
multiple items, but append() adds one. The insert() method requires
a position argument. Understanding mutability is critical for debugging."
```

## Migration Path

For existing plain-text quizzes:
1. Reduce from 20-30 → 5-10 questions (keep highest-impact)
2. Convert answer letters (a/b/c/d) → indices (0/1/2/3)
3. Move answer key explanations into `explanation` properties
4. Format as Quiz component JSX
5. Validate using updated quality-checklist.md

---

## Next Steps

1. **Use the skill:** Trigger phrase: "Create a quiz for Chapter X using the Quiz component"
2. **Reference example:** See `example-quiz.md` for complete working implementation
3. **Validate:** Use quality-checklist.md (v3.0) for validation
4. **Test:** Preview in Docusaurus to verify component rendering
5. **Iterate:** Refine based on student feedback and learning outcomes

## Version History

- **v1.0:** Original 20-30 question plain-text markdown format
- **v2.0:** Added anti-cheating measures (option length strategy)
- **v3.0 (Current):** Migrated to interactive Quiz component, 5-10 questions, instant feedback
