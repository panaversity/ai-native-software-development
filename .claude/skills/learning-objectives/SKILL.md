# Learning Objectives Skill

## Purpose

Enable educators to create **measurable, actionable learning objectives** aligned with Bloom's taxonomy. This skill helps:
- Define what students will achieve (not just what topics they'll cover)
- Ensure objectives are specific and testable (not vague)
- Identify prerequisites and scaffold learning progressively
- Plan appropriate assessment methods
- Sequence learning from basic recall to creative synthesis

## When to Activate

Use this skill when:
- Planning curriculum or lesson design and need to define learning outcomes
- Creating assessments and want to align them with clear objectives
- Designing a course and need measurable outcomes for accreditation
- Educators ask to "define objectives", "create learning goals", "set outcomes", or "what should students achieve?"
- Reviewing existing objectives and wondering if they're specific enough
- Designing a lesson and unsure what students should be able to do by the end

## Process

### Step 1: Understand the Context

When a request comes in to generate learning objectives, first understand:
- **What topic or concept?** (Python decorators, OOP, async/await, etc.)
- **Who are the learners?** (Beginners, intermediate, advanced)
- **How long to teach?** (30 minutes, 2 hours, full unit)
- **What's the end goal?** (Can they build something? Understand theory? Debug code?)

### Step 2: Review Bloom's Taxonomy (If Needed)

If you're not familiar with the specific topic's cognitive levels, read:
üìñ [reference/blooms-taxonomy-programming.md](reference/blooms-taxonomy-programming.md)

This document maps Bloom's 6 levels to programming contexts with:
- Action verbs for each level (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create)
- Programming examples
- Assessment methods for each level

### Step 3: Identify Prerequisites

Read the guidance on prerequisite analysis:
üìñ [reference/prerequisite-analysis.md](reference/prerequisite-analysis.md)

For your objectives, determine:
- What must learners know BEFORE tackling the main concept?
- List prerequisites at Remember/Understand level (not deep mastery)
- Trace dependency chains to foundational knowledge

### Step 4: Choose Assessment Methods

Based on the Bloom's level of each objective, review appropriate assessment methods:
üìñ [reference/assessment-methods.md](reference/assessment-methods.md)

This guides you to pair objectives with realistic assessment approaches (code exercises for Apply level, code reviews for Evaluate, etc.).

### Step 5: Generate Objectives

For each topic, create 3-5 objectives (typically):
- At least one from each level needed for the topic (Remember through Create)
- Progressively building in complexity
- Each with clear statement, context, prerequisites, assessment method, and success criteria

Use the template as guidance:
üìÑ [templates/learning-objective-template.yml](templates/learning-objective-template.yml)

**Key principle**: Each objective should answer:
- **What will learners DO?** (verb from Bloom's level)
- **In what context?** (the specific situation or problem)
- **How will we know they succeeded?** (measurable criteria)

### Step 6: Validate for Measurability

Once you've generated objectives, invoke the validation script to check they're measurable:

```bash
python .claude/skills/learning-objectives/scripts/validate-objectives.py objectives.yml
```

The script checks:
- ‚úÖ Objectives use action verbs (not vague words like "understand" or "know")
- ‚úÖ Objectives are specific and testable
- ‚úÖ Verbs match the Bloom's level
- ‚úÖ Required fields present (context, assessment, success criteria)

If validation fails, review the error messages and refine:
- Replace vague verbs with specific action verbs from Bloom's level
- Add missing context or success criteria
- Make statements more specific (not just topic names)

### Step 7: Refine and Finalize

Based on validation feedback:
- Revise any objectives with errors
- Ensure the objective sequence makes sense (build progressively)
- Verify prerequisites are necessary but not excessive
- Check that assessment methods are realistic for the time available

## Output Format

Present learning objectives in clear, structured format:

```yaml
topic: "Topic Name"
objectives:
  - id: "LO-001"
    statement: "Action verb + what learner will do"
    blooms_level: "Remember/Understand/Apply/Analyze/Evaluate/Create"
    context: "Specific situation or problem"
    prerequisites:
      - "Prerequisite 1"

    assessment_method: "How this will be assessed"
    success_criteria:
      - "Criterion 1"
      - "Criterion 2"
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Short Tutorial (30 minutes)
- 1 Understand objective
- 1 Apply objective
- 1 Analyze objective
- ~Total: 3 objectives

### Pattern 2: Standard Lesson (1-2 hours)
- 1 Remember objective (if foundational topic)
- 1 Understand objective
- 2 Apply objectives (different contexts/complexities)
- 1 Analyze objective
- ~Total: 4-5 objectives

### Pattern 3: Full Unit (3-5 hours)
- 1 Remember (terminology)
- 1 Understand (concepts)
- 2-3 Apply (varied contexts)
- 1 Analyze (relationships)
- 1 Evaluate (quality)
- 1 Create (synthesis)
- ~Total: 7-8 objectives

### Pattern 4: Capstone/Project Course
- Lightweight foundational objectives (Remember/Understand)
- Multiple Apply objectives with increasing complexity
- Strong Analyze/Evaluate/Create focus
- Capstone project as final assessment

## Troubleshooting

### Objective Too Vague

**Problem**: "Understand decorators"

**Why it's bad**: Not measurable. What does "understand" mean? How will you know if they understand?

**Solution**: Use specific action verb and add context
- ‚úÖ "Explain how a decorator wraps a function to modify its behavior"
- ‚úÖ "Implement a custom decorator that logs function calls"

### Too Many Objectives

**Problem**: Created 15 objectives for 1-hour lesson

**Solution**: Reduce to 3-5 objectives. Ask:
- Which are essential? (Keep)
- Which are "nice to have"? (Remove or move to extension)
- Are some redundant? (Consolidate)

### Prerequisites Are Too Deep

**Problem**: Prerequisites include "Master Python" and "Understand all design patterns"

**Solution**: Be minimal. Ask: "What's the absolute minimum they need to know to start learning this?"
- Too deep: "Master all data structures"
- Just right: "Understand how lists work with indexing"

### Can't Think of Higher Bloom's Levels

**Problem**: Only created Remember and Apply objectives

**Solution**:
1. Read blooms-taxonomy-programming.md ¬ß4-6 for Analyze/Evaluate/Create examples
2. Ask: "What can learners do with this knowledge?" (Points toward Create)
3. Add analysis question: "Compare this approach with X..."
4. Add evaluation: "Would this solution work for Y? Why/why not?"

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill works well with:

**‚Üí exercise-designer skill**: Once you have learning objectives, use that skill to create practice exercises aligned to each objective's Bloom's level

**‚Üí technical-clarity skill**: Use to review the clarity of your objective statements

**‚Üí code-example-generator skill**: Use to create examples that demonstrate Apply-level objectives

## Emerging Topics: Agentic AI & Model Context Protocol (MCP)

    success_criteria:
      - "Server correctly implements MCP protocol"
      - "Tools are well-defined with clear descriptions"
      - "Client can successfully call server tools"
      - "Code is documented and maintainable"
```

**Key Considerations for Advanced Topics**:
- These topics may require deeper prerequisites (solid Python, API design knowledge)
- Use spiral learning: revisit concepts at increasing depth (basic agent ‚Üí advanced orchestration)
- Include both theory (understanding architecture) and practice (implementing tools)
- Assessment should emphasize real problem-solving, not just definitions

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with the end in mind**: What should learners be able to DO, not what will you teach?
2. **Make them testable**: Ask "How would I know if this objective was met?"
3. **Use consistent Bloom's level progression**: Build from simple to complex
4. **Include prerequisites**: Help learners self-assess readiness
5. **Validate often**: Use the validation script to catch vague language
6. **Test with real learners**: Objectives often need refinement based on actual usage

---

**Ready to generate objectives?** Provide:
- Topic/concept to teach
- Target learner level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- Available teaching time
- End goal (build project? understand theory? debug code?)

Or paste existing objectives and I'll help make them more measurable!
