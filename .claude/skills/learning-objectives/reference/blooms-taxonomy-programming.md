## Level 5: Evaluate

**Cognitive Goal**: Justify decisions based on criteria and standards

**Definition**: Learners can assess code quality, make judgments about correctness, security, efficiency, or style based on established criteria. They can defend design decisions and identify improvements.

### Action Verbs (Use These!)
- Evaluate
- Assess
- Appraise
- Critique
- Judge
- Justify
- Defend
- Select (based on criteria)

## Level 6: Create

**Cognitive Goal**: Put elements together to form something new; original synthesis

**Definition**: Learners can design new programs, create original solutions, invent algorithms, design architectures, and combine concepts in novel ways. They can identify limitations and extend systems.

### Action Verbs (Use These!)
- Create
- Design
- Build

## Programming Context: Cognitive Load Considerations

When designing learning objectives, consider:

### Remember & Understand (Foundational)
- **Duration**: 20-30% of instruction
- **Load**: Low (basic facts, terminology)
- **Risk**: Overwhelming learners with too much memorization

### Apply (Crucial for Programming)
- **Duration**: 40-50% of instruction
- **Load**: Medium (guided practice)
- **Risk**: Insufficient practice = surface learning

### Analyze, Evaluate, Create (Deep Learning)
- **Duration**: 20-30% of instruction
- **Load**: High (requires synthesis)
- **Risk**: Pushing too fast without foundation = frustration

## Design Principle: Avoid Vague Language

❌ **Avoid These Verbs** (ambiguous, unclear):
- Know
- Understand (without context)
- Learn
- Study
- Appreciate
- Get
- Think about
- Be familiar with
- Grasp
- Comprehend

✅ **Use These Instead** (measurable, specific):
- Define (Remember)
- Explain (Understand)
- Apply (Apply)
- Compare (Analyze)
- Evaluate (Evaluate)
- Design (Create)

## Example: Building a Learning Objectives Sequence

For teaching **Python Exception Handling**:

1. **Remember**: Define exception and error
2. **Understand**: Explain difference between try/except/finally blocks
3. **Apply**: Write code using try/except for file handling
4. **Analyze**: Examine exception hierarchy and identify appropriate catch blocks
5. **Evaluate**: Assess whether exception handling strategy is adequate for requirements
6. **Create**: Design custom exception classes for domain-specific errors

Each level builds on previous understanding.
