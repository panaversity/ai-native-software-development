# CoLearning Python Documentation Site

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator for the CoLearning Python book project.

## Quick Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Start local development server:**
```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window at `http://localhost:3000`. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Available Scripts

### Development
```bash
npm start
```
Starts the development server with hot reload.

### Build
```bash
npm run build
```
This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Serve Build
```bash
npm run serve
```
Serves the built site locally for testing the production build.
