# CoLearning Python: The AI-Driven Way

## Vision

"CoLearning Python: The AI-Driven Way" is a 26-chapter technical book that teaches modern AI-driven development using Python (3.13+) through systematic collaboration between human learners and AI assistants. 

Our vision is to pioneer a new agent-native paradigm of CS education where AI is a co-learner and a collaborator, reflecting the reality of modern software development.

## Core Philosophy

*   **AI as a Collaborative Partner:** We treat AI tools as intelligent co-workers, working together within shared constraints.
*   **Specification-First Methodology:** Clear requirements precede all work. We use the "Spec-Kit" methodology for iterative, AI-friendly development.
*   **Learning by Doing:** Every concept is practiced through realistic, AI-assisted hands-on work.
*   **Transparency:** We teach our methodology and demonstrate it throughout the book.

## Target Audience

*   **Primary:** Programming beginners with no prior coding experience.
*   **Secondary:** Professional developers transitioning to AI-driven development.

## Key Features

*   **AI-First Learning:** Learn Python with AI as a partner from day one.
*   **Modern Python:** All code uses Python 3.13+ features with mandatory type hints.
*   **Pedagogically Sound:** Content is guided by 8 specialized "co-learning skills" based on educational research.
*   **Structured and Consistent:** A project constitution and defined output styles ensure a high-quality, consistent reading experience.
*   **Tool Diversity:** Learn to work with a variety of AI tools, including Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and OpenAI Codex.

## The 8 CoLearning Skills

1.  **learning-objectives:** Generate measurable learning outcomes.
2.  **concept-scaffolding:** Break down complex topics into manageable steps.
3.  **code-example-generator:** Create high-quality, runnable code examples.
4.  **exercise-designer:** Design effective practice exercises.
5.  **assessment-builder:** Build meaningful quizzes and assessments.
6.  **technical-clarity:** Ensure all explanations are clear and accessible.
7.  **book-architecture:** Structure the book's content for a logical flow.
8.  **ai-augmented-teaching:** Design lessons that effectively integrate AI tools.

## Book Structure

The book is divided into five parts:

1.  **Part 1: Introducing AI-Driven Development (5 chapters):** Get started with AI tools and basic Python.
2.  **Part 2: Spec-Kit Methodology (5 chapters):** Learn a professional workflow for AI-assisted development.
3.  **Part 3: AI Tool Landscape (4 chapters):** A deep dive into various AI platforms and editors.
4.  **Part 4: Prompt & Context Engineering (4 chapters):** Master the art of effective communication with AI.
5.  **Part 5: Modern Python with Type Hints (8 chapters):** Learn advanced Python features with a focus on type safety and testing.
