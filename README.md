# CoLearning Python & Agentic AI: The AI-Driven Way

## Vision

"CoLearning Python & Agentic AI: The AI-Driven Way" is a 32-chapter technical book that teaches modern AI-driven development using Python (3.13+) through systematic collaboration between human learners and AI assistants. It progresses from foundational concepts through advanced topics including agentic AI systems and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). 

Our vision is to pioneer a new agent-native paradigm of CS education where AI is a co-learner and a collaborator, reflecting the reality of modern software development.

## Core Philosophy

*   **AI as a Collaborative Partner:** We treat AI tools as intelligent co-workers, working together within shared constraints.
*   **Specification-First Methodology:** Clear requirements precede all work. We use the "Spec-Kit" methodology for iterative, AI-friendly development.
*   **Learning by Doing:** Every concept is practiced through realistic, AI-assisted hands-on work.
*   **Transparency:** We teach our methodology and demonstrate it throughout the book.

## Target Audience

*   **Primary:** Programming beginners with no prior coding experience.
*   **Secondary:** Professional developers transitioning to AI-driven development.

## Key Features

*   **AI-First Learning:** Learn Python with AI as a partner from day one.
*   **Modern Python:** All code uses Python 3.13+ features with mandatory type hints.
*   **Pedagogically Sound:** Content is guided by 8 specialized "co-learning skills" based on educational research.
*   **Structured and Consistent:** A project constitution and defined output styles ensure a high-quality, consistent reading experience.
*   **Tool Diversity:** Learn to work with a variety of AI tools, including Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and OpenAI Codex.

### 🏷️ Naming Conventions

| Level          | Format                | Example                                  |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Part folder    | `##-Name/`            | `02-AI-Driven-Development/`      |
| Chapter folder | `##-Chapter-Name/`    | `01-Python-Basics/`                      |
| Lesson file    | `##-Lesson-Name.md`   | `01-Getting-Started.md`                 |

---

### 📐 Docusaurus Compatibility

This structure uses **Docusaurus number prefixes** for automatic sidebar ordering.

- Each folder/file uses `##-Name` format for automatic ordering
- Docusaurus automatically removes number prefixes from URLs and titles
- Folders become sidebar categories, files become sidebar items

#### 🔗 Internal Linking

Use relative links between topics:

```md
See [Variables and Types](./02-Variables-and-Types.md) for more details.
```

### ✅ Book Agent Output Rules

The book-generation agent must:

1. Write Docusaurus-compatible Markdown with frontmatter
2. Follow strict numbered naming conventions (`##-Name` format)
3. Use number prefixes for automatic sidebar ordering
4. Include the 3-level hierarchy:
   - **Part folders** (`##-Part-##-Name/`)
   - **Chapter folders** (`##-Chapter-Name/`)
   - **Lesson files** (`##-Lesson-Name.md`)
5. Avoid duplicate names or invalid characters

---

### 💡 Best Practices

- Use consistent number prefixes (`01-`, `02-`, etc.) for proper ordering
- Keep folder/file names descriptive but concise
- Use hyphens instead of underscores for better URL readability
