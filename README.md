# CoLearning Python & Agentic AI: The AI-Driven Way

## Vision

"CoLearning Python & Agentic AI: The AI-Driven Way" is a 32-chapter technical book that teaches modern AI-driven development using Python (3.13+) through systematic collaboration between human learners and AI assistants. It progresses from foundational concepts through advanced topics including agentic AI systems and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). 

Our vision is to pioneer a new agent-native paradigm of CS education where AI is a co-learner and a collaborator, reflecting the reality of modern software development.

## Core Philosophy

*   **AI as a Collaborative Partner:** We treat AI tools as intelligent co-workers, working together within shared constraints.
*   **Specification-First Methodology:** Clear requirements precede all work. We use the "Spec-Kit" methodology for iterative, AI-friendly development.
*   **Learning by Doing:** Every concept is practiced through realistic, AI-assisted hands-on work.
*   **Transparency:** We teach our methodology and demonstrate it throughout the book.

## Target Audience

*   **Primary:** Programming beginners with no prior coding experience.
*   **Secondary:** Professional developers transitioning to AI-driven development.

## Key Features

*   **AI-First Learning:** Learn Python with AI as a partner from day one.
*   **Modern Python:** All code uses Python 3.13+ features with mandatory type hints.
*   **Pedagogically Sound:** Content is guided by 8 specialized "co-learning skills" based on educational research.
*   **Structured and Consistent:** A project constitution and defined output styles ensure a high-quality, consistent reading experience.
*   **Tool Diversity:** Learn to work with a variety of AI tools, including Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and OpenAI Codex.
