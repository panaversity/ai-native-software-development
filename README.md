## ðŸŽ¯ Vision

**CoLearn â€“ AI Dev Way** is a **46-chapter technical book and open specification** that redefines how we learn programming in the era of intelligent tools.
It teaches **AI-driven development** through *systematic collaboration between human learners and AI assistants*, using **Python (3.13+)** and **TypeScript** as the foundation.

The learning journey flows from fundamentals to advanced AI systems â€” including:

* **Agentic AI Development** with the OpenAI Agents SDK
* **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** and **FastMCP** integration
* **Spec-Kit Plus methodology** for AI-driven software design
* **Realtime and voice agents**, **containerized deployments**, and **event-driven architectures**

---

## ðŸ’¡ Mission

To pioneer an **agent-native model of computer science education** where AI is:

* a **co-learner**, participating in exploration and debugging,
* a **collaborator**, shaping ideas and architectures, and
* a **creative partner**, empowering the next generation of AI developers.

## ðŸ“˜ Structure Overview

1. **AI-Driven Development Foundations**
2. **AI Tool Landscape: Gemini, Claude, Codex**
3. **Prompt & Context Engineering**
4. **Python: The Language of AI Agents**
5. **Spec-Kit Plus Methodology**
6. **OpenAI Agents SDK in Python**
7. **MCP & FastMCP Fundamentals**
8. **TypeScript for Realtime & Interaction**
9. **Building Realtime & Voice Agents**
10. **Containerization & Orchestration**
11. **Data, State & Memory (SQL, Graph, Vector)**
12. **Event-Driven Architecture with Kafka & Dapr**
13. **Stateful Agents with Dapr Actors & Workflows**

## Core Philosophy

*   **AI as a Collaborative Partner:** We treat AI tools as intelligent co-workers, working together within shared constraints.
*   **Specification-First Methodology:** Clear requirements precede all work. We use the "Spec-Kit" methodology for iterative, AI-friendly development.
*   **Learning by Doing:** Every concept is practiced through realistic, AI-assisted hands-on work.
*   **Transparency:** We teach our methodology and demonstrate it throughout the book.

## Target Audience

*   **Primary:** Programming beginners with no prior coding experience.
*   **Secondary:** Professional developers transitioning to AI-driven development.

## Key Features

*   **AI-First Learning:** Learn Python with AI as a partner from day one.
*   **Modern Python:** All code uses Python 3.13+ features with mandatory type hints.
*   **Pedagogically Sound:** Content is guided by 8 specialized "co-learning skills" based on educational research.
*   **Structured and Consistent:** A project constitution and defined output styles ensure a high-quality, consistent reading experience.
*   **Tool Diversity:** Learn to work with a variety of AI tools, including Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and OpenAI Codex.
