## Prompt

/sp.plan

Execute the plan workflow for Chapter 3 redesign specification (specs/004-chapter-3-redesign/spec.md) using the chapter-planner subagent.

## Response snapshot

Successfully generated comprehensive implementation plan and task checklist for Chapter 3 redesign.

**Plan Structure** (plan.md, 8.7 KB):
- **Summary**: Transformation goal (fluffy ‚Üí concrete strategic frameworks)
- **Technical Context**: Conceptual/narrative chapter, 2,000-2,500 words, grade 7-9 reading level, 8-12 min reading time
- **Constitution Check**: Validated against all 11 core principles + Book Gaps Checklist (PASSED, zero violations)
- **Section Architecture**: 8 logical sections covering all 6 user stories:
  1. Opening Hook & Introduction (300 words)
  2. Snakes and Ladders Framework (400 words) ‚Äî User Story 1
  3. Economics of Super Orchestrators (400 words) ‚Äî User Story 2
  4. Code Reuse ‚Üí Vertical Intelligence (350 words) ‚Äî User Story 3
  5. Piggyback Protocol Pivot Strategy (400 words) ‚Äî User Story 4
  6. Three Requirements for Success (250 words) ‚Äî User Story 5
  7. Pause and Reflect (100-150 words) ‚Äî Thought experiment
  8. Closing‚ÄîYour Move (300 words) ‚Äî User Story 6 + Chapter 4 bridge
- **Scaffolding Strategy**: Cognitive load management, concept introduction order, jargon definitions, engagement patterns
- **Validation Strategy**: 10 success criteria + 40+ validation checklist items
- **Next Steps**: Handoff to Lesson-Writer subagent for implementation

**Task Breakdown** (tasks.md, 20 KB):
- **Phase 1: Preparation** (2 hours) ‚Äî Context gathering, file structure identification, evidence compilation
- **Phase 2: Section Writing** (5-6 hours) ‚Äî 8 detailed section tasks with specific acceptance criteria and word counts
- **Phase 3: Evidence Verification** (1.5-2 hours) ‚Äî Fact-checking all claims, source verification, accessibility checks
- **Phase 4: Visual Elements** (1 hour) ‚Äî Diagram embedding, comparison tables creation, frontmatter formatting
- **Phase 5: Quality Checks** (1.5-2 hours) ‚Äî 40+ validation checklist, user story verification, success criteria validation
- **Phase 6: Integration** (1 hour) ‚Äî Chapter 2 callback and Chapter 4 forward bridge verification
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 12-point Definition of Done
- **Risks & Mitigations**: 5 identified risks with mitigation strategies

**Core Frameworks Planned**:
- Snakes and Ladders competitive layers (WITH visual diagram)
- Super Orchestrators economics (Instagram 13/$1B, WhatsApp 55/$19B, Claude Code $500M ARR)
- Reusable Vertical Intelligence (5 subagent components)
- Piggyback Protocol Pivot (3-phase strategy with concrete example)
- Three Requirements for Vertical Success (fine-tuned models + integrations + agentic solutions)

**Engagement Elements**:
- 5-8 concrete stories with specific details (names, numbers, outcomes)
- 3-5 historical comparisons (mobile OS precedents, small team success examples)
- 1-2 thought experiments (Pause and Reflect sections)
- 2-3 comparison tables
- 2 video embeds (English + Urdu/Hindi)
- Proactive skepticism addressing with evidence

**Estimated Total Effort**: 8-12 hours (planning complete, ready for implementation)

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Created comprehensive implementation plan transforming approved specification into actionable writing tasks. Plan provides clear roadmap for lesson-writer subagent with 8-section architecture, detailed acceptance criteria, quality gates, and integration points. Enables systematic chapter creation with measurable quality standards.

- üß™ Tests:
  - Constitution alignment: PASSED (all 11 principles validated)
  - Section architecture: PASSED (8 sections mapped to 6 user stories, 2,400 words total)
  - Task granularity: PASSED (50+ specific tasks with acceptance criteria)
  - Quality gates: PASSED (10 success criteria + 40+ validation items documented)
  - Integration points: PASSED (Chapter 2 callback and Chapter 4 bridge specified)

- üìÅ Files:
  - Created: specs/004-chapter-3-redesign/plan.md (8.7 KB, comprehensive implementation plan)
  - Created: specs/004-chapter-3-redesign/tasks.md (20 KB, detailed task checklist with 6 phases)
  - Referenced: specs/004-chapter-3-redesign/spec.md (specification with 6 user stories, 24 requirements)
  - Referenced: .specify/memory/constitution.md (validation against v2.2.0)

- üîÅ Next prompts:
  1. "Invoke lesson-writer subagent to implement Section 1: Opening Hook & Introduction"
  2. "After implementation: Invoke technical-reviewer subagent to validate against success criteria"
  3. "After validation: Create integration PR for Chapter 3 redesign"

- üß† Reflection:
  - Successfully transformed specification (459 lines, 6 user stories) into actionable plan (8 sections, 50+ tasks)
  - Chapter-planner subagent correctly identified conceptual/narrative content type (no code examples)
  - Section architecture logically sequences concepts: frameworks ‚Üí evidence ‚Üí strategies ‚Üí integration
  - Each section has clear word count targets totaling 2,000-2,500 (within spec requirements)
  - Task breakdown provides specific acceptance criteria making progress measurable
  - Constitution check validated all 11 principles align (zero violations)
  - Integration points clearly specified (Chapter 2 callback, Chapter 4 bridge)
  - Quality gates reference all validation items from spec (10 success criteria, 40+ checklist items)
  - Risk mitigation strategies proactively address potential issues (jargon complexity, evidence verification, reading level)
  - Plan enables lesson-writer to work systematically section-by-section with clear handoff points

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Planning phase completed successfully without errors or blockers.

- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
  - Constitution Alignment: PASS (validated all 11 core principles)
  - Section Architecture: PASS (8 sections map to 6 user stories)
  - Task Granularity: PASS (50+ tasks with acceptance criteria)
  - Word Count Targets: PASS (2,000-2,500 total, section breakdowns reasonable)
  - Quality Gates: PASS (all validation mechanisms documented)
  - Integration Points: PASS (Chapter 2 and Chapter 4 connections specified)

- Prompt variant (if applicable): Initial plan generation (no variants tested)

- Next experiment (smallest change to try):
  - Test lesson-writer subagent with Section 1 task to validate plan effectiveness
  - Monitor if acceptance criteria are specific enough to guide writing
  - Evaluate if 300-word targets for sections are realistic for content density required
  - Consider whether 8 sections should be consolidated to 6-7 for better flow
  - After first section: assess if engagement patterns (stories, comparisons) are naturally emerging or need explicit prompting
