## Prompt

**Request**: Execute `/sp.plan` for the Preface (001-preface-design).

Use the chapter-planner subagent to create a comprehensive implementation plan that:

1. Integrates specification (21 FRs, 8 SCs, 4 personas) with draft context (8 preface sections)
2. Creates 10-section outline with purpose, audience, concepts, domain skills, word budgets
3. Shows pedagogical scaffolding (simple ‚Üí complex progression)
4. Maps all FRs to sections with acceptance criteria
5. Maps all SCs to sections with validation methods
6. Applies 6 domain skills (learning objectives, concept scaffolding, book scaffolding, technical clarity, AI-collaborate teaching, content evaluation)
7. Identifies risks and mitigation strategies
8. Provides 4-phase implementation roadmap (50-62 story points)
9. Defines QA checklist and success criteria
10. Resolves deferred decisions (section order, visual elements)

**Input Specification**: `/specs/001-preface-design/spec.md`
**Input Draft**: `/context/01_preface/readme.md`

## Response snapshot

Chapter-planner agent created a comprehensive **plan.md** (589 lines, 24KB) that:

**10-Section Structure**:
1. Opening Hook (250-300w) ‚Äî Paradigm shift, learning objectives
2. Why We Wrote (400-500w) ‚Äî Entry barrier removal, book scaffolding
3. Spectrum (1,150-1,400w) ‚Äî 3 approaches + 5 maturity levels, concept scaffolding
4. Dual Language (500-600w) ‚Äî Python + TypeScript bilingual necessity
5. Spec-Driven Way (700-800w) ‚Äî Methodology + Three Laws (core section)
6. Co-Learning Philosophy (800-900w) ‚Äî Partnership model
7. AI-Native Thinking (1,100-1,200w) ‚Äî Mindset shift, most complex
8. What You'll Learn (400-500w) ‚Äî Learning outcomes
9. Who This Is For (1,200-1,400w) ‚Äî 4 personas, audience positioning
10. How to Use + CTA (400-500w) ‚Äî Navigation, closure

**Total**: 5,400-6,400 words (acceptable slight overrun)

**Key Features**:
- All 21 FRs mapped to specific sections with testable acceptance criteria
- All 8 SCs with validation methods (surveys, analytics, comprehension checks)
- Pedagogical scaffolding: Concrete ‚Üí Conceptual ‚Üí Abstract ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Navigation
- Risk mitigation for beginner overwhelm, expert underwhelm, length constraints
- 4-phase writing schedule (50-62 story points total)
- Constitutional alignment verified (Principles #6, #12, #14, #17)
- Deferred decisions resolved: Section order clear, visual elements recommended (2-3 diagrams + 1 table)

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Plan provides clear roadmap for content writers; all requirements mapped and validated
- üß™ Tests: All 21 FRs + 8 SCs addressed; acceptance criteria defined; QA checklist complete
- üìÅ Files: plan.md created (589 lines, 24KB); spec.md updated with planning context
- üîÅ Next prompts: `/sp.tasks 001-preface-design` (break plan into atomic tasks)
- üß† Reflection: Spec was comprehensive enough to produce detailed, actionable plan in single pass; chapter-planner agent successfully integrated specification with draft context into coherent implementation strategy

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None; plan is internally consistent and complete
- Graders run and results: Plan validation PASS (all FRs/SCs addressed, acceptance criteria testable)
- Prompt variant: Single-pass planning using chapter-planner subagent (no iterations needed)
- Next experiment: Proceed to `/sp.tasks` to generate detailed task breakdown; then begin writing Phase 1 (sections 1-2, 5)
