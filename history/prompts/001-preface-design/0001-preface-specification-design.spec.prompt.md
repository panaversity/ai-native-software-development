## Prompt

**User Request**: Design and write a compelling Preface for the textbook "AI Native Software Development: Colearning Agentic AI with Python and TypeScript ‚Äì The AI & Spec Driven Way."

The preface will serve as the first section of the book, located at book-source/docs/ before Chapter 01. It should:

1. Introduce readers to AI-native development philosophy
2. Present the AI development spectrum (Assisted, Driven, Native)
3. Map to organizational maturity levels (1-5)
4. Ground content in co-learning principles
5. Establish the book's unique value: making AI-native development accessible to everyone through specification-driven approaches, bilingual development (Python & TypeScript), and human-AI collaboration

**Context**: The user provided extensive draft material covering:
- Preface opening hook and vision statement
- Three AI development approaches with examples
- 5 organizational maturity levels with progression patterns
- Co-learning philosophy with Three Laws
- Dual language importance (Python + TypeScript)
- Specification-driven methodology
- Book promise and audience identification
- Pedagogical grounding in constitution v3.0.0

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive specification for the Preface design feature that:

1. **Defined 4 distinct user personas** (Student, Developer, Educator, Founder) with P1-P3 priorities
2. **Specified 21 Functional Requirements** covering:
   - Content structure (9 major sections)
   - Tone and voice (accessible + rigorous)
   - Constitutional alignment (Principles #6, #12, #14, #17)
   - Pedagogical intent (thinking before coding, validation as core skill)
3. **Established 8 Success Criteria** with measurable targets:
   - Non-technical readers can explain AI-native development
   - Developers can distinguish 3 approaches and map maturity levels
   - 85% positive sentiment from all audiences
   - 80% completion rate
   - 80% educator alignment rating
4. **Identified Edge Cases**: non-English readers, Python experience, skipped preface, overwhelmed readers, print/digital formats
5. **Set Clear Constraints**: 4,500‚Äì6,000 words, no implementation code, no tool recommendations, print + digital compatible
6. **Created Quality Checklist**: 20-item validation checklist confirming specification readiness

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Specification provides clear direction for planning and content creation; removes ambiguity; establishes measurable success criteria
- üß™ Tests: Quality checklist complete (20/20 items passing); specification self-contained and unambiguous
- üìÅ Files: spec.md (260 lines), checklists/requirements.md (150 lines), history/prompts PHR
- üîÅ Next prompts: `/sp.plan 001-preface-design` to create detailed outline and section-by-section plan
- üß† Reflection: Specification successfully bridges the book's provided vision/draft content with structured, testable requirements; ready for planning phase

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None; specification is complete and internally consistent
- Graders run and results: Quality checklist PASS (all items confirmed)
- Prompt variant: N/A (single-pass specification creation)
- Next experiment: Plan phase will assign domain skills to sections and create content outline
