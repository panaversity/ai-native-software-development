## Prompt

**Request**: Perform `/sp.clarify` analysis on the Preface specification (001-preface-design).

Perform a structured ambiguity scan using the clarification taxonomy:
- Functional Scope & Behavior
- Domain & Data Model
- Interaction & UX Flow
- Non-Functional Quality Attributes
- Integration & External Dependencies
- Edge Cases & Failure Handling
- Constraints & Tradeoffs
- Terminology & Consistency
- Completion Signals
- Misc / Placeholders

Identify critical ambiguities that would materially impact planning, code generation, or validation. Queue up to 5 high-impact clarification questions if necessary. Stop if no critical ambiguities exist.

**Context**: Specification created earlier in session with comprehensive user stories, 21 functional requirements, 8 success criteria, and explicit edge cases.

## Response snapshot

Performed structured ambiguity scan across all 9 taxonomy categories:

**Results**:
- 7 categories: **Clear** (fully specified, no gaps)
- 2 categories: **Partial** (identified but deferred to planning phase as they're design/UX decisions, not functional blockers)

**Critical Ambiguities Found**: ZERO

**Deferred Items** (not worth formal clarification):
1. Section sequencing/flow order ‚Äî Better decided during planning with full context
2. Visual elements (diagrams, tables) ‚Äî Design decision, doesn't block requirements

**Conclusion**: Specification is **comprehensive and ready for planning**. All functional requirements are testable, success criteria are measurable, and pending decisions are explicitly flagged in the spec.

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Specification validated as unambiguous; cleared to proceed to planning phase
- üß™ Tests: Ambiguity scan PASS; no blocking issues found
- üìÅ Files: No new files created (clarification not needed)
- üîÅ Next prompts: `/sp.plan 001-preface-design` (specification ready for planning)
- üß† Reflection: Thorough specification design paid off‚Äîminimal ambiguity detected; team can proceed with confidence to planning and content creation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None; specification is internally consistent and complete
- Graders run and results: Ambiguity scan PASS (0 critical blockers)
- Prompt variant: Single-pass clarification review (no follow-up questions needed)
- Next experiment: Move directly to planning; observe if deferred decisions (section order, visuals) require clarification during plan phase
