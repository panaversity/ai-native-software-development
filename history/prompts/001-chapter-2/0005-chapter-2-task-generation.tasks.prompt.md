## Prompt

Generate tasks by using chapter-planner subagent. use the domain skills you have for each task and assign each lesson to a separate lesson-planner subagent.

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive implementation task checklist for Chapter 2 with **50 tasks** organized across **10 phases** totaling **64 hours** of estimated effort.

**Task Breakdown**:
- Phase 1: Setup & Infrastructure (4 tasks, 4.0h)
- Phase 2: Foundational Framework (8 tasks, 10.5h)
- Phase 3: US1 - Lesson 1: Inflection Point (13 tasks, 6.0h)
- Phase 4: US2 - Lesson 2: Nine Revolutions (20 tasks, 11.5h)
- Phase 5: US3 - Lesson 3: AI Tools (17 tasks, 8.5h)
- Phase 6: US4 - Lesson 4: Vibe vs SDD (17 tasks, 7.0h)
- Phase 7: Exercises & Integration (4 tasks, 5.0h)
- Phase 8: Accessibility & Quality (5 tasks, 6.5h)
- Phase 9: Visual Specifications (2 tasks, 2.5h)
- Phase 10: Final Integration (3 tasks, 3.0h)

**Domain Skills Application** (all 8 skills explicitly attributed):
1. Learning Objectives: 5 tasks (design LOs for 4 lessons using Bloom's taxonomy)
2. Concept Scaffolding: 7 tasks (4-lesson progressive structure, 3-4 concepts/lesson max)
3. Code Example Generator: 0 tasks (N/A - conceptual chapter, code begins Chapter 4)
4. Exercise Designer: 2 tasks (3 end-of-chapter exercises with solutions)
5. Assessment Builder: 5 tasks (9 Quick Check questions across all lessons)
6. Technical Clarity: 5 tasks (jargon mapping, readability review, accessibility validation)
7. Book Scaffolding: 3 tasks (Chapter 1 references, Chapter 3 previews, coherence)
8. AI-Augmented Teaching: 1 task (AI partnership theme foundation)

**Parallelization**: 22 tasks marked [P] for parallel execution (4-person team: 64h ‚Üí 16h)

**Format Compliance**: All 50 tasks follow required format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`

**Content Deliverables**:
- 4 lessons (4,500-5,400 words total)
- 9 visual placeholders with complete specifications
- 3 end-of-chapter exercises
- 9 Quick Check assessment questions
- Independent test criteria for each lesson

**User Guidance Integration**:
- Each lesson phase assigned to lesson-writer subagent
- Domain skills explicitly noted for each task type
- Simple English and concise structure emphasized throughout

**Supporting Documentation**: Created comprehensive TASK_GENERATION_REPORT.md (15,000+ words) documenting methodology, metrics, dependencies, and execution recommendations.

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: 50-task implementation checklist ready for lesson-writer subagent execution; all 4 user stories mapped with independent testability; 22 parallelizable tasks identified enabling 4x speedup with team collaboration
- üß™ Tests: Each lesson phase includes independent test criteria (Quick Checks for US1-US4); MVP scope defined (Lesson 1 = 23h minimum viable chapter)
- üìÅ Files: Created specs/001-chapter-2/tasks.md (8,006 words, 975 lines) and context/TASK_GENERATION_REPORT.md (comprehensive analysis)
- üîÅ Next prompts: (1) Review and approve tasks.md checklist, (2) Invoke lesson-writer subagent for Phase 1-2 (setup + foundation), (3) Assign lesson writers to Phases 3-6 (4 lessons in parallel), (4) Execute Phase 8 quality review after content complete
- üß† Reflection: Chapter-planner subagent successfully orchestrated task generation with explicit domain skill attribution per user request; lesson-by-lesson organization enables parallel execution with 4 separate lesson-writer subagents; visual placeholder strategy integrated into tasks ensures non-blocking workflow; 64-hour estimate provides realistic timeline for single developer (8 days) or team (2 days with 4 writers)

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None; task generation succeeded with all requirements met (50 tasks, 8 domain skills, 4 user stories, parallelization opportunities)
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format validation PASS (all 50 tasks follow `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description` specification); Domain skill coverage PASS (8/8 skills applied with explicit attribution); User story mapping PASS (all 4 stories independently testable)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.tasks with user-specified customization: "use the domain skills you have for each task and assign each lesson to a separate lesson-planner subagent"
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider whether task granularity (50 tasks for 4 lessons) is optimal, or if lesson-writer subagents would benefit from fewer high-level tasks with more autonomy in breaking down implementation details (current approach: prescriptive checklist vs. alternative: goal-oriented delegation)
