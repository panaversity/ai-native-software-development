## Prompt

update the tasks from the generated plan

Context: User requested task generation/update for Chapter 6 following the planning phase. The /sp.tasks command was triggered to transform the plan and spec into actionable implementation tasks with proper formatting.

## Response snapshot

Successfully generated comprehensive task checklist for Chapter 6: Gemini CLI: Installation and Basics with strict `/sp.tasks` formatting requirements.

**Tasks File Updated**: `specs/001-chapter-6/tasks.md` (367 lines)

**Task Organization** (Educational Content Structure):
- **84 discrete, testable tasks** organized into 11 phases
- **45+ parallelizable tasks** marked with [P]
- **All 7 user stories** mapped with [US1]-[US7] labels
- **T001-T084** sequential task IDs following strict format

**Phase Breakdown**:
1. **Phase 1**: Chapter Foundation (7 tasks - T001-T007) - Create lesson outlines
2. **Phase 2**: User Story 1 (P1) - Installation & Authentication (14 tasks - T008-T021)
3. **Phase 3**: User Story 2 (P1) - First Commands (6 tasks - T022-T027)
4. **Phase 4**: User Story 6 (P2) - Tool Comparison (6 tasks - T028-T033)
5. **Phase 5**: User Story 3 (P2) - Built-In Tools (7 tasks - T034-T040)
6. **Phase 6**: User Stories 4-5 (P2-P3) - Context Window & Extensions (10 tasks - T041-T050)
7. **Phase 7**: Command Verification (9 tasks - T051-T059) - Cross-platform testing
8. **Phase 8**: Exercises & Assessments (7 tasks - T060-T066)
9. **Phase 9**: Cross-Cutting Concerns (6 tasks - T067-T072)
10. **Phase 10**: Integration & Cross-Reference (5 tasks - T073-T077)
11. **Phase 11**: Review & Finalization (7 tasks - T078-T084)

**User Story Mapping Table**:
| Story | Priority | Focus | Lessons | Task Range |
|-------|----------|-------|---------|-----------|
| US1 | P1 | Installation & Auth | 2-3 | T008-T021, T051-T053, T061-T062 |
| US2 | P1 | First Commands | 3-4 | T022-T027, T054, T063 |
| US3 | P2 | Built-In Tools | 5 | T034-T040, T055-T058, T064 |
| US4 | P2 | Context Window | 6 | T041-T044 |
| US5 | P3 | Extensions | 6 | T032, T046-T047 |
| US6 | P2 | Tool Comparison | 1, 6 | T028-T031, T033, T045, T049-T050, T060, T065 |
| US7 | P3 | Qwen Code | 1, 6 | T021, T048 |

**Format Compliance**:
- ‚úÖ All tasks follow `- [ ] T### [P?] [US#?] Description with file path` format
- ‚úÖ Checkbox (`- [ ]`) at start of every task
- ‚úÖ Sequential IDs (T001-T084)
- ‚úÖ [P] markers for parallelizable tasks (45+ identified)
- ‚úÖ [US#] labels where tasks map to user stories
- ‚úÖ File paths included in task descriptions

**Dependencies & Parallel Work**:
- **Sequential**: Phase 1 ‚Üí Phases 2-6 ‚Üí Phase 7 ‚Üí Phase 8 ‚Üí Phase 9 ‚Üí Phase 10 ‚Üí Phase 11
- **Within phases**: Up to 6 lessons can be written in parallel (Phases 2-6)
- **Platform testing**: Windows/Mac/Linux testing can run in parallel (Phase 7)
- **Exercise design**: All 7 exercise tasks can run in parallel (Phase 8)

**MVP Implementation Strategy**:
1. **MVP** (P1 priority): US1-US2 - Lessons 2-4 (Installation, Auth, First Commands)
2. **Second Increment** (P2): US6 - Lessons 1, 6 (Context, Comparison)
3. **Third Increment** (P2): US3-US4 - Lesson 5-6 (Tools, Context Window)
4. **Final Increment** (P3): US5, US7 - Extensions and Qwen Code mentions

**Adaptation from Standard Template**:
This is a **book chapter** (educational content), not software development. Tasks adapted to focus on:
- Content creation (writing lessons, not code)
- Command verification (testing real Gemini CLI commands)
- Pedagogical design (exercises, assessments)
- Cross-platform testing (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- Educational quality gates (accessibility, technical accuracy)

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Complete, formatted task checklist ready for lesson-writer implementation; 84 discrete tasks with clear dependencies and parallel work identification
- üß™ Tests: Format validation passed (all T001-T084 format correct), User story coverage validated (all US1-US7 mapped), Parallel work identified (45+ [P] markers)
- üìÅ Files: Updated specs/001-chapter-6/tasks.md (367 lines, 84 tasks across 11 phases)
- üîÅ Next prompts: Begin implementation with /sp.implement or manually work through tasks starting with Phase 1 (lesson outlines)
- üß† Reflection: Successfully adapted standard /sp.tasks format for educational content while preserving user story mapping and parallel work identification. The 11-phase structure balances pedagogical progression (organized by lesson/topic) with engineering discipline (sequential IDs, dependency tracking, MVP strategy). Distinction between "book chapter tasks" vs "software feature tasks" is clear: focus shifts from code implementation to content creation, command testing, and educational design.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - task generation executed successfully with proper formatting
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format validation - PASS (T001-T084 format correct); User story mapping - PASS (all US1-US7 covered); Parallel identification - PASS (45+ tasks marked)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.tasks invocation adapted for educational content (book chapter, not software)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementing T001-T007 (lesson outlines) to validate whether task descriptions provide sufficient detail for content creators
