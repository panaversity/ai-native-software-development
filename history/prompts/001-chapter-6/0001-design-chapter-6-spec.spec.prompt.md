## Prompt

Design chapter 6. Check the part 2 goal provided at @book-source\docs\02-AI-Tool-Landscape\README.md and the context here @context\07_chap6_spec\

Context from user input files:
- Part 2 README: Describes the goal of transforming learners from theoretical understanding to practical capability with AI development tools (Chapters 5-8)
- Context file: Specifies Chapter 6 title "Google Gemini CLI: Open Source and Everywhere" and key features (Apache 2.0 license, 60 requests/min + 1,000 requests/day free tier, Gemini 2.5 Pro with 1M token context, MCP-based, extensions similar to Claude Code skills, Qwen Code fork with 2,000 requests/day free tier)
- Official documentation links provided for installation, authentication, configuration, examples, commands, tutorials, and extensions

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for Chapter 6 following SpecKit SDD methodology:

**Specification created**: `specs/001-chapter-6/spec.md`

**Key components**:
1. **Overview**: Positioned Chapter 6 as second in Part 2 AI Tool Landscape, introducing Gemini CLI as accessible open-source alternative to Claude Code with unique advantages (open source, generous free tier, 1M token context, MCP extensibility)

2. **7 Prioritized User Stories**:
   - P1: First-time installation and authentication
   - P1: Basic configuration and first command
   - P2: Built-in tools exploration (search, file ops, web fetch, shell)
   - P2: Understanding 1M token context window
   - P3: Gemini CLI Extensions introduction
   - P2: Comparing Gemini CLI to Claude Code
   - P3: Qwen Code as alternative implementation

3. **15 Functional Requirements** covering installation, authentication, commands, built-in tools, context window, extensions, comparison framework, troubleshooting, quota management, MCP explanation, Qwen Code, hands-on exercises, realistic development tasks, tool selection guidance, and documentation links

4. **10 Measurable Success Criteria** (all technology-agnostic): installation within 15 min, authentication within 10 min, execute 5+ commands, explain context window practically, create 5-criteria comparison table, identify 2+ scenarios for each tool, troubleshoot 1+ issue, locate 1+ extension, explain MCP in 1-2 sentences, 90% first-attempt completion rate

5. **Clear Scope**: Comprehensive in-scope coverage (installation, auth, commands, tools, comparison, troubleshooting) with explicit out-of-scope items deferred to later chapters

6. **Risk Mitigation**: 6 risks identified with specific mitigation strategies (documentation changes, quota changes, regional restrictions, dependency confusion, learner overwhelm, extension complexity)

**Quality validation**: Created and validated specification quality checklist (`checklists/requirements.md`) - all items PASSED, no clarifications needed

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Complete, validated specification for Chapter 6 ready for planning phase (`/sp.plan` or `/sp.clarify`)
- üß™ Tests: Specification quality checklist validation passed all items (content quality, requirement completeness, feature readiness)
- üìÅ Files: Created spec.md (325 lines, comprehensive) and requirements.md checklist
- üîÅ Next prompts: Execute `/sp.plan` to create detailed lesson plans and task checklists for Chapter 6 implementation
- üß† Reflection: Specification demonstrates strong alignment with Part 2 goals (hands-on capability building), constitutional principles (accessibility, AI-augmented learning, tool diversity), and pedagogical best practices (progressive scaffolding, show-then-explain). The 7 user stories provide clear implementation roadmap with appropriate priority levels.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - specification process executed smoothly following SpecKit SDD template
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Specification quality checklist - PASS (all 14 criteria met)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard `/sp.specify` command with context files provided
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to planning phase to validate whether specification provides sufficient detail for lesson breakdown and task generation
