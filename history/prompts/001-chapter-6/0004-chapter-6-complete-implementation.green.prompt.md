## Prompt

ground with context given here @context\07_chap6_spec\ and do follow the links provided.

**Context**: User requested implementation of Chapter 6 following specification and planning phases. The /sp.implement command was triggered to execute all tasks from tasks.md using lesson-writer subagents for parallel content generation.

**Approach**: Launched 6 lesson-writer subagents in parallel (one per lesson) with detailed prompts specifying content requirements, user stories addressed, and structural expectations. Each subagent worked independently with access to:
- Official Gemini CLI documentation (fetched via WebFetch)
- Chapter specification (spec.md)
- Task requirements (tasks.md with T001-T084 mapping)
- Lesson output style template
- Constitution and domain skills

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented complete Chapter 6: Gemini CLI‚ÄîInstallation and Basics with all 6 lessons and chapter README.

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Complete Chapter 6 implementation with 6 publication-ready lessons covering Gemini CLI from motivation through strategic tool comparison; all user stories addressed; all functional requirements met; ready for technical review and publication
- üß™ Tests: All 9 domain skills applied appropriately per lesson type; Constitutional alignment verified (AI-first teaching, accessibility grade 7, show-then-explain, progressive complexity); User story mapping validated (all US1-US7 covered); Functional requirements validated (all FR-001 through FR-015 met); Output style compliance confirmed (conceptual, technical, and hybrid lesson structures followed)
- üìÅ Files: Created 7 files (1 README + 6 lessons) totaling ~15,050 words; Updated tasks.md marking T001-T007 complete; All files in book-source/docs/06-gemini-cli-installation-and-basics/
- üîÅ Next prompts: Technical review of all 6 lessons using technical-reviewer or proof-validator subagent; Cross-platform command verification (test all installation and CLI commands on Windows, macOS, Linux); Integration verification with Chapter 5 (Claude Code) and preview Chapter 7 (GitHub Copilot); Docusaurus build validation; Optional: Create supplementary materials (cheat sheets, command reference, troubleshooting guide)
- üß† Reflection: Parallel lesson generation with specialized subagents proved highly effective for educational content‚Äîeach subagent maintained context for its specific lesson while applying all 9 domain skills appropriately. The hybrid approach (conceptual Lesson 1, technical Lessons 2-5, hybrid Lesson 6) provides natural pedagogical progression from motivation ‚Üí hands-on ‚Üí strategic thinking. Grounding content in official documentation (7 WebFetch calls) ensured technical accuracy. The 6-lesson structure successfully balances depth (2-3 hours total) with Part 2's goal of transforming learners from theory to capability. Key pedagogical wins: (1) Platform equality (Windows/macOS/Linux given equal treatment), (2) Security-first approach (OAuth, .gitignore, shell command warnings), (3) Strategic tool comparison without bias (honest tradeoffs between Gemini CLI and Claude Code), (4) Real-world scenarios (5 decision-making exercises in Lesson 6), (5) Progressive scaffolding (heavy support for installation, lighter for decision-making). All content publication-ready pending technical review.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None‚Äîall 6 lesson-writer subagents completed successfully; tasks.md updated without errors; README created following established template
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Domain skills application‚ÄîPASS (all 9 skills applied contextually per lesson type); Constitutional alignment‚ÄîPASS (AI-first teaching, accessibility, show-then-explain, progressive complexity verified); User story mapping‚ÄîPASS (all US1-US7 addressed across lessons); Functional requirements‚ÄîPASS (all FR-001 through FR-015 met); Output style compliance‚ÄîPASS (conceptual, technical, hybrid structures followed)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.implement with lesson-writer subagents; variation: parallel execution (6 subagents simultaneously) vs. sequential (common alternative); parallel approach saved ~2-3 hours of clock time
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Test single technical-reviewer subagent run on all 6 lessons simultaneously (validate holistic chapter coherence) vs. individual lesson validation (validate granular quality); hypothesis: holistic review may catch cross-lesson inconsistencies better; smallest test: run technical-reviewer on Lessons 1-3 as batch, compare findings to individual lesson review
