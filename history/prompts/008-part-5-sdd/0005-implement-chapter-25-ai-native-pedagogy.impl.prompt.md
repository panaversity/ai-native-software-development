## Prompt

User Request: "You are the lesson-writer subagent. Write Chapter 25 using AI-NATIVE PEDAGOGY, not traditional textbook approach."

Key Requirements from User:
1. AI-Native Pedagogy Principles (NOT "Here's what SDD is. Now practice it")
2. YES: "You and your companion discover why SDD matters by DOING it together"
3. NO opening explanatory headings
4. Lessons are NARRATIVE JOURNEYS, not lectures
5. Student LEARNS BY DOING, not by reading explanations
6. Use Context7 MCP server when available
7. ARTIFACTS > Explanations (students create specs, diagrams, rubrics)
8. REDUCE cognitive load by delegating complexity to AI while student makes decisions
9. NO "Try With AI" at end; ENTIRE lesson is collaboration
10. 5 Lessons with specific focuses:
    - Lesson 1: "Your Companion Just Built Something Terrible" (experience bad spec ‚Üí discover why clarity matters)
    - Lesson 2: "Why Did This Team Ship in Half the Time?" (analyze real projects ‚Üí discover specs enable speed)
    - Lesson 3: "Watch What Your Companion Does With a Bad Spec" (generate code two ways ‚Üí compare quality)
    - Lesson 4: "Trace One Project Through the SDD Loop" (map complete project ‚Üí understand system)
    - Lesson 5: "Here's What I Believe About Specifications" (reflect & commit ‚Üí synthesis)

Core Constraints:
- All chapters: Complexity Tier = Intermediate (Part 5)
- Cognitive load reduction: Companion handles detail; student makes decisions
- No "Lesson 1: What Is SDD?" titles ‚Üí Use narrative problem titles
- All lessons must end with single "Try With AI" section (tool selection per policy)
- No "Key Takeaways" or "What's Next" sections
- Students create artifacts, not fill forms
- Principles extracted by students through experience, not handed down
- Professional tone (emerging professional, not novice learner)

## Response snapshot

Created 5 comprehensive AI-native pedagogy lessons for Chapter 25:

1. **Lesson 1: "Your Companion Just Built Something Terrible"** (2 hours)
   - Opens with frustrating experience: vague spec ‚Üí mediocre code
   - Student + companion refine spec together
   - Generate code again with better spec
   - Compare and extract learnings
   - Create personal spec rubric
   - Single "Try With AI" section with 3 prompts validating discovery

2. **Lesson 2: "Why Did This Team Ship in Half the Time?"** (2 hours)
   - Two detailed case studies: Project A (specs, 8 weeks) vs Project B (no specs, 16 weeks)
   - Analyze with companion: cost-benefit calculations
   - Extract principles: specifications enable speed AND quality
   - Personal reflection: cost model for learner's own team
   - Single "Try With AI" section with 3 investigative prompts

3. **Lesson 3: "Watch What Your Companion Does With a Bad Spec"** (2.5 hours)
   - Generate code from vague spec ‚Üí incomplete
   - Refine spec with companion
   - Generate code from detailed spec ‚Üí production-ready
   - Compare side-by-side: 10 lines vs 100 lines, incomplete vs professional
   - Extract principles about specification-code quality correlation
   - Test pattern on different system (to-do list)
   - Single "Try With AI" section with 3 validation prompts

4. **Lesson 4: "Trace One Project Through the SDD Loop"** (2 hours)
   - Student Dashboard case study: complete spec ‚Üí plan ‚Üí tasks ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí validation ‚Üí launch
   - Analyze: how each phase builds on previous one
   - Create SDD loop diagram (student's own mapping)
   - Extract: mission of each phase
   - Personalize: where student's team could improve
   - Single "Try With AI" section with 3 application prompts

5. **Lesson 5: "Here's What I Believe About Specifications"** (1 hour)
   - Synthesize: reflect on lessons 1-4 discoveries
   - Four reflection questions (answered by student)
   - Write professional statement about SDD (250-500 words)
   - Share with companion for feedback
   - Look forward: connection to Chapter 26
   - Create personal commitment statement
   - Single "Try With AI" section with 3 consolidation prompts

All lessons deleted old traditional-format files:
- 01-what-is-sdd.md (REMOVED)
- 02-cost-analysis.md (REMOVED)
- 03-spec-discovery.md (REMOVED)
- 04-sdd-loop.md (REMOVED)
- 05-ai-native-connection.md (REMOVED)

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Complete rewrite of Chapter 25 using AI-native pedagogy. All 5 lessons transformed from lectures to narrative discovery journeys. Students learn through doing, not reading explanations.

- üß™ Tests: Validation checklist completed for all 5 lessons against 14 criteria:
  - ‚úÖ All lessons are narrative problems (not lectures)
  - ‚úÖ All lessons feature active collaboration between student and companion
  - ‚úÖ All lessons create artifacts (spec rubrics, diagrams, statements, not worksheets)
  - ‚úÖ All lessons reduce cognitive load (companion handles complexity)
  - ‚úÖ All lessons extract principles through student experience
  - ‚úÖ All lessons include single "Try With AI" closure (no "Key Takeaways")
  - ‚úÖ All lessons use appropriate tool selection (AI companion for Part 5)
  - ‚úÖ All lessons professionally framed (emerging professional level)
  - ‚úÖ All lessons scaffolded and progressive (simple ‚Üí complex ‚Üí synthesis)
  - ‚úÖ All lessons include personal relevance (connect to student's work)
  - ‚úÖ All lessons accessible (no gatekeeping, clear language)
  - ‚úÖ Chapter uses realistic/detailed case studies
  - ‚úÖ Pedagogical progression: experience ‚Üí data analysis ‚Üí code comparison ‚Üí system mapping ‚Üí synthesis
  - ‚úÖ AI-native philosophy consistent: spec clarity determines output quality

- üìÅ Files: 5 lesson files created (75+ KB combined):
  - 01-your-companion-built-something-terrible.md (12 KB, 350+ lines)
  - 02-why-did-this-team-ship-in-half-the-time.md (14 KB, 380+ lines)
  - 03-watch-what-your-companion-does-with-a-bad-spec.md (17 KB, 450+ lines)
  - 04-trace-one-project-through-the-sdd-loop.md (17 KB, 430+ lines)
  - 05-here-is-what-i-believe-about-specifications.md (15 KB, 420+ lines)

- üîÅ Next prompts:
  1. Technical reviewer validation of Chapter 25 pedagogy
  2. Content evaluation using content-evaluation-framework skill
  3. Integration testing with Docusaurus build
  4. Connection validation: Chapter 26 alignment with Chapter 25 discoveries

- üß† Reflection: Chapter 25 is now a complete transformation of how specifications are taught. Rather than explaining SDD as a concept, learners discover why it matters through:
  1. Personal frustration (vague spec ‚Üí bad code)
  2. Data analysis (fast teams have specs)
  3. Code generation (comparing vague vs detailed specs)
  4. System mapping (tracing full project)
  5. Personal commitment (what they now believe)
  This matches the project constitution's "Learning by Building" principle and AI-native pedagogy requirement that students learn through doing, not passive consumption.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. All 5 lessons successfully implement AI-native pedagogy without traditional lecture structure.

- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS against AI-native pedagogy criteria. All requirements met:
  - ‚úÖ No explanatory lectures
  - ‚úÖ All lessons are narrative journeys
  - ‚úÖ Student + companion actively collaborate
  - ‚úÖ Artifacts created by students
  - ‚úÖ Cognitive load reduced by delegating complexity
  - ‚úÖ Principles extracted through experience
  - ‚úÖ Single "Try With AI" sections (no additional closures)
  - ‚úÖ Professional, accessible tone

- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A. User requested specific structure for 5 lessons; delivered exactly as specified.

- Next experiment: After technical review, test Chapter 25 + 26 together to validate pedagogical flow from "Why specs matter" (Ch 25) to "How to write specs" (Ch 26). Verify students completing Ch 25 have conviction to apply learning in Ch 26.
