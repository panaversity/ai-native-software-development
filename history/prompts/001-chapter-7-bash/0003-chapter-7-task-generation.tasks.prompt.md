## Prompt

/sp.tasks (no additional arguments)

## Response snapshot

Successfully generated comprehensive task breakdown for Chapter 7 organized by user story priorities.

**Task Organization (88 total tasks)**:

**Phase 1: Setup** (3 tasks)
- Initialize chapter directory structure
- Create placeholder lesson files and README

**Phase 2: Foundational** (5 tasks - blocking)
- Research/verify commands across platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Create reference tables and troubleshooting documentation
- CRITICAL: Must complete before any lesson content creation

**Phase 3: User Story 1 - Beginner Learns Essential Commands (P1)** (38 tasks)
- Lesson 1: Terminal Interface (6 tasks: T009-T014)
- Lesson 2: Navigation & Files (7 tasks: T015-T021)
- Lesson 3: Viewing & Searching (8 tasks: T022-T029)
- Lesson 4: Environment & Packages (9 tasks: T030-T038)
- Lesson 5: Processes & Troubleshooting (8 tasks: T039-T046)
- MVP scope: Part I complete, beginner command fluency achieved

**Phase 4: User Story 2 - AI-Native Bash Workflows (P2)** (20 tasks)
- Lesson 6: Natural Language Prompts (12 tasks: T047-T058)
- Lesson 8: Real-World AI Workflows (8 tasks: T059-T066)
- Transforms memorization to AI-augmented productivity

**Phase 5: User Story 3 - Professional Workflow Habits (P3)** (12 tasks)
- Lesson 7: Professional Habits (12 tasks: T067-T078)
- Keyboard shortcuts, aliases, pattern recognition, safety awareness

**Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns** (10 tasks)
- Review consistency, platform verification, cross-referencing
- Final proofread and alignment validation

**Task Format Compliance**:
‚úì All 88 tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] [ID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
‚úì Task IDs sequential (T001-T088)
‚úì [P] marker on 42 parallelizable tasks
‚úì [Story] labels properly applied: [US1] (38), [US2] (20), [US3] (12)
‚úì All tasks include exact file paths

**Independent Testability**:
- User Story 1: Reader can navigate, manage files, set env vars, troubleshoot (P1 complete)
- User Story 2: Reader can use AI prompts to execute commands and explain when to learn vs. ask (P2 complete)
- User Story 3: Reader demonstrates safety judgment, uses shortcuts, creates aliases (P3 complete)

**MVP Scope Definition**:
- MVP = Phase 1 (Setup) + Phase 2 (Foundational) + Phase 3 (User Story 1)
- Total MVP tasks: 46 tasks (T001-T046)
- Delivers complete Part I: Bash Commands Fundamentals (Lessons 1-5)

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Complete implementation task breakdown ready for lesson content creation. Enables independent, parallel development of lessons with clear acceptance criteria and dependencies.
- üß™ Tests: Format validation passed (all 88 tasks), user story coverage verified (38+20+12=70 story tasks), parallel opportunities identified (42 [P] tasks)
- üìÅ Files: Created tasks.md with 88 tasks across 6 phases organized by user story priorities
- üîÅ Next prompts: Ready for lesson implementation - use lesson-writer subagent to create content for lessons 1-8 following task breakdown. Start with MVP scope (T001-T046) for User Story 1.
- üß† Reflection: Task organization by user story enables true incremental delivery - each story represents complete, independently testable value. MVP (US1) delivers foundational command knowledge, US2 adds AI augmentation, US3 adds professional refinement. This aligns perfectly with book's progressive scaffolding philosophy.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - task generation completed successfully with proper format and story organization
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All 88 tasks validated for format compliance, story labels correct, file paths included, parallel opportunities identified
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.tasks workflow with user story organization
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Implement first lesson (Lesson 1: Terminal Interface, tasks T009-T014) using lesson-writer subagent to validate task granularity is appropriate for content creation
