## Prompt

User request: `/sp.implement ground with source context @context\08_chap7_spec\`

Task: Implement Chapter 7: "Bash Essentials for AI-Driven Development" with 8 lessons (Part I: Bash Commands fundamentals; Part II: AI-augmented workflows). Source material provided from context directory with complete Bash command reference and natural language prompt templates.

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented all 8 lessons + README (~67KB total content):
- Lessons 1-5: Terminal basics, navigation, file operations, environment variables, process management
- Lessons 6-8: Natural language prompts, professional habits, real-world workflows
- Used hybrid approach: subagents for complex lessons, direct creation for streamlined content
- Emphasized safety throughout (rm warnings, verification patterns)
- Cross-platform support (macOS/Linux/Windows Git Bash)

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Complete chapter ready for validation (10 files created)
- üß™ Tests: Manual validation performed
- üìÅ Files: All 8 lessons + README + implementation summary
- üîÅ Next: Run proof-validator agent for quality verification
- üß† Reflection: Hybrid approach balanced thoroughness with efficiency

## Evaluation notes

- Failure modes: Initial subagent interruption handled by adapting to direct creation
- Graders: Self-validated; formal proof-validation pending
- Prompt variant: Standard /sp.implement with source context
- Next experiment: Pre-determine subagent vs direct creation based on lesson complexity
