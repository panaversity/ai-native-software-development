## Prompt

Design chapter 7. Check the part 2 goal provided at @book-source\docs\02-AI-Tool-Landscape\README.md and the source content to generate specs @context\08_chap7_spec\

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for Chapter 7: "Bash Essentials for AI-Driven Development" following the /sp.specify workflow:

**Specification Structure**:
- 3 prioritized user stories (P1: Learn essential commands, P2: AI-native workflows, P3: Professional habits)
- 15 functional requirements covering navigation, file management, process control, environment variables, package management, natural language prompts
- 10 measurable success criteria focused on reader capabilities and time-to-competence
- Comprehensive edge cases, assumptions, scope definition, dependencies, constraints, and risk mitigation

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Two-part chapter structure: Part I teaches commands directly, Part II introduces AI augmentation
- Prioritization ensures P1 delivers MVP (basic command proficiency), P2 adds AI workflows, P3 refines habits
- Focus on 90% of commonly used commands rather than exhaustive coverage
- Platform-specific guidance for macOS, Linux, and Windows (Git Bash/WSL)
- Natural language prompt templates for every command to bridge traditional and AI-augmented learning

**Validation Results**:
All specification quality checklist items passed:
‚úì No implementation details
‚úì Technology-agnostic success criteria
‚úì Testable requirements
‚úì Complete acceptance scenarios
‚úì Clear scope boundaries
‚úì No unresolved clarifications

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Complete specification document ready for planning phase. Provides clear foundation for lesson design with measurable learning outcomes and prioritized user journeys.
- üß™ Tests: Specification quality checklist validation completed - all 14 items passed. Ready for /sp.plan.
- üìÅ Files: Created 2 files - spec.md (main specification) and checklists/requirements.md (validation checklist)
- üîÅ Next prompts: `/sp.plan` to create detailed lesson-by-lesson implementation plan and task breakdown for Chapter 7
- üß† Reflection: The two-part structure (commands first, AI augmentation second) effectively balances foundational learning with AI-driven productivity. Prioritization allows for iterative development if needed.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Initial attempt to run create-new-feature.sh failed because branch already existed; adapted by creating directory structure manually
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All specification quality checklist items validated successfully
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify workflow with source content reference
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to planning phase to validate whether the specification provides sufficient detail for lesson implementation
