## Prompt

Ensure we're not hallucinating anything and we're grounding the sources with factual accuracy.

## Response snapshot

Conducted systematic ambiguity scan focused on factual accuracy and evidence grounding. Asked 5 targeted clarification questions to prevent hallucination:

**5 Clarifications Made:**

1. **Value Proposition Language** (Q1): Changed "billion-dollar vertical solutions" ‚Üí "solutions for billion-dollar potential markets" to accurately represent market opportunity vs guaranteed outcomes

2. **"Markdown as Programming Language" Terminology** (Q2): Verified against Spec-Kit Plus methodology (https://github.com/panaversity/spec-kit-plus/blob/main/spec-driven.md); confirmed accurate within SDD paradigm where Markdown-formatted natural language specs are executable source of truth; added clarifying note to FR-003

3. **Survey Data Requirements** (Q3): Embedded verification requirement in FR-004 - writer must cite current statistics from credible surveys (GitHub Developer Survey, Stack Overflow Survey, JetBrains State of Developer Ecosystem) at time of writing

4. **Historical Precedent Structure** (Q4): Specified 3-5 comparisons must include: (1) infrastructure paradigm shift, (2) development methodology evolution, (3) competitive disruption example, plus 1-2 writer's choice - updated Content Enrichment Patterns section

5. **Tool Verification Requirements** (Q5): Added to Assumptions #4 - writer must verify key capabilities described for each tool are accurate at time of writing, with fallback language if tool status changes (e.g., "Tools like Claude Code and similar AI coding agents...")

**Coverage Summary:**
All 10 taxonomy categories assessed: 7 Clear (already sufficient), 3 Resolved (was Partial/Missing, now addressed), 0 Outstanding, 0 Deferred. Spec ready for `/sp.plan`.

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Eliminated factual accuracy risks by embedding verification requirements directly into functional requirements and assumptions. Spec now guards against hallucination through mandatory evidence sourcing, tool capability verification, structured historical comparisons, and accurate market opportunity language.
- üß™ Tests: Coverage analysis complete (all categories resolved or clear). 5 clarifications validated and integrated. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain.
- üìÅ Files: Updated spec.md with new Clarifications section (Session 2025-10-29), modified User Story 1, FR-003, FR-004, Assumptions #4, and Content Enrichment Patterns #2.
- üîÅ Next prompts: `/sp.plan` to create implementation plan. Spec is factually grounded and ready for planning phase.
- üß† Reflection: Effective clarification session that transformed vague requirements into specific, verifiable quality gates. Key insight: embedding verification requirements in spec (rather than just documenting assumptions) ensures future content creators cannot skip factual grounding. The Spec-Kit Plus methodology verification for "Markdown as Programming Language" was crucial - user provided authoritative source that validated the seemingly unusual terminology.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. All 5 questions answered on first attempt. User provided external source (Spec-Kit Plus docs) when terminology questioned, demonstrating good collaborative clarification.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Coverage analysis PASS (10/10 categories resolved or clear). Integration validation PASS (all clarifications correctly embedded in spec). No contradictory statements remain.
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.clarify workflow with emphasis on "factual accuracy and grounding sources" per user request
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider adding a "Sources & References" section to spec template for educational content where citations are critical (would have centralized the survey/tool/historical precedent requirements)
