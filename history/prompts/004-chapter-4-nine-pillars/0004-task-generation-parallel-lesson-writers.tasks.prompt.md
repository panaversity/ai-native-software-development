## Prompt

Create tasks based on the plan and specs. For every lesson, invoke a separate lesson-writer subagent. You can run them in parallel for efficiency. Ground with the content in the link https://github.com/panaversity/spec-kit-plus/tree/main/docs-plus#the-nine-pillars-of-ai-driven-development-aidd and do not hallucinate.

## Response snapshot

**Workflow Executed:**
1. Launched 7 lesson-writer subagents in parallel (as requested)
2. Subagents ran in isolated environments and generated comprehensive content
3. Extracted content from subagent outputs and wrote all 7 sections to repository
4. User corrected path from `book-source/docs/part-1/chapter-4-nine-pillars/` to `book-source/docs/01-Introducing-AI-Driven-Development/04-nine-pillars/`
5. Changed file extension from .mdx to .md per project structure

**All 7 Sections Written Successfully:**

| Section | Filename | Size | Content Summary |
|---------|----------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | 01-why-new-paradigm.md | 7.2KB | Opening hook with Priya/Marcus story, partial adoption problem, nine revolutions context, AIDD as system concept |
| 2 | 02-aidd-defined.md | 7.4KB | Clear AIDD definition, comparison table (Traditional vs AIDD), value proposition, Sarah's example |
| 3 | 03-pillars-overview.md | 6.6KB | All nine pillars listed with integration table, interdependencies, Maya's story, M-shaped preview |
| 4 | 04-pillars-detailed.md | 18KB | Complete detailed explanation of all nine pillars with consistent structure, 5 concrete stories, interactive exercises |
| 5 | 05-m-shaped-developer.md | 7.6KB | M-Shaped definition with comparison table, how nine pillars enable multi-domain mastery, 3 real profiles |
| 6 | 06-why-all-nine-matter.md | 7.9KB | Comparison table (6/9 vs 9/9), 3 historical precedents, Sarah/Marcus stories, opportunity-focused urgency |
| 7 | 07-journey-ahead.md | 5.5KB | Chapter recap, pillar-to-book-structure mapping table, progressive mastery breakdown, forward momentum |

**Total Content:** ~60KB across all 7 sections

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Complete Chapter 4 content delivered. All 7 sections written to correct path with proper file extension. Comprehensive AIDD methodology established with nine pillars framework, M-Shaped developer concept, competitive urgency (opportunity-focused), and clear roadmap to remaining 42 chapters.

- üß™ Tests: Structure validation PASS - all sections follow lesson.md conceptual chapter template. Content completeness PASS - all required elements present (hooks, reflections, transitions, tables, stories). File verification PASS - all 7 files exist at correct path with .md extension. Total content: 60KB.

- üìÅ Files: 7 section files created in `book-source/docs/01-Introducing-AI-Driven-Development/04-nine-pillars/`. Tasks.md structure exists in specs directory. Ready for Phase 6 (Integration & QA) and Phase 7 (Final Polish).

- üîÅ Next prompts: Execute Phase 6 tasks (T014-T022): Review sections for narrative flow consistency, verify Content Enrichment Patterns (5-8 stories ‚úì, 3-5 historical comparisons ‚úì, thought experiments ‚úì), accessibility validation (Grade 7 level), cross-chapter coherence with Chapters 1-3. Then Phase 7: Create chapter index, verify frontmatter, Docusaurus build validation.

- üß† Reflection: Parallel lesson-writer execution successful. Key insight: Subagents run in isolated environments - their outputs must be extracted and written to repository by main agent. User correction of path and file extension was necessary. Content quality is high with all required elements. Section 04 (18KB) is appropriately longer due to detailed nine-pillar explanations. All conceptual chapter requirements met: storytelling, reflection prompts, transitions, no code examples.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Initial attempt to write to wrong path (part-1 vs 01-Introducing-AI-Driven-Development). File extension mismatch (.mdx vs .md). Both corrected by user.

- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Structure validation PASS. Content completeness PASS. File creation PASS. Path correction PASS. All 7 sections verified at correct location.

- Prompt variant (if applicable): Executed /sp.tasks with immediate parallel lesson-writer invocations. Content extraction and repository writing performed by main agent after subagent completion.

- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Future optimization - clarify repository paths and file extensions upfront to avoid path corrections. Consider creating chapter index.md as part of this workflow rather than waiting for Phase 7.
