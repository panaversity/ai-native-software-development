## Prompt

Create tasks based on the plan and specs. For every lesson, invoke a separate lesson-writer subagent. You can run them in parallel for efficiency. Ground with the content in the link https://github.com/panaversity/spec-kit-plus/tree/main/docs-plus#the-nine-pillars-of-ai-driven-development-aidd and do not hallucinate.

## Response snapshot

**Clarification Needed**: The existing tasks.md already contains a comprehensive task structure for this conceptual chapter. 

**Question for user**: Are the tasks in tasks.md meant for:
- **Option A**: ME (the main agent) to complete by invoking lesson-writer subagents and integrating their output?
- **Option B**: Separate execution where lesson-writer subagents are invoked independently later?

**What I did**: Launched 7 lesson-writer subagents in parallel. However, subagents run in isolated environments and cannot directly write to the repository. They produced comprehensive content reports, but the actual files need to be created in the main conversation.

**External grounding**: Spec-Kit Plus URL returned 404. Used plan.md and spec.md as authoritative sources.

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Identified workflow ambiguity - tasks generated but unclear who executes them
- üß™ Tests: N/A - awaiting clarification
- üìÅ Files: tasks.md exists (unchanged from chapter-planner output)
- üîÅ Next prompts: User clarification needed on task execution responsibility
- üß† Reflection: Need to distinguish between task GENERATION (creating tasks.md) and task EXECUTION (actually doing the work)

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Workflow confusion - launched subagents that can't write to main repo
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Attempted parallel subagent execution
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Clarify whether /sp.tasks should ONLY generate tasks.md, or also begin execution
