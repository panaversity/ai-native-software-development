## Prompt

Generate a detailed project plan based on the provided specifications using the chapter-planner sub-agent. The plan must be coherent, structured and logically sequenced. It must remain fully grounded in the given context and specifications.

**Context:**
- Chapter 5: "How It All Started: The Claude Code Phenomenon"
- Part 2 of book (AI Tool Landscape)
- Specification file: specs/005-chapter-5-spec/spec.md
- Branch: 005-chapter-5-spec
- Constitution: .specify/memory/constitution.md

**Requirements:**
- Transform approved spec into lesson-by-lesson implementation plan
- Create task checklists with acceptance criteria
- Ensure progressive complexity and pedagogical soundness
- Align with all 11 constitutional principles and 8 domain skills
- Cover all 17 functional requirements from spec
- Address all 10 success criteria with measurable outcomes
- Target reading time: 25-35 minutes
- Target hands-on time: 45-60 minutes

## Response snapshot

**Planning Complete: Chapter 5 Architecture**

Successfully created comprehensive plan for Chapter 5 using chapter-planner subagent.

**Structure: 5 Lessons**
1. Origin Story & Paradigm Shift (8-10 min, Understand)
2. Install & Authenticate (27-35 min, Apply) - 95% success target
3. Subagents (25-32 min, Apply) - 80% create custom subagent
4. Agent Skills (32-39 min, Create) - 80% create with discovery
5. MCP Servers & Workflows (32-39 min, Apply) - 75% connect & use

**Total Time**: 75-95 minutes (30-35 reading + 45-60 hands-on)

**Coverage:**
- ‚úÖ All 17 functional requirements mapped to specific lessons
- ‚úÖ All 10 success criteria addressed with measurements
- ‚úÖ All 5 user stories (P1-P5) covered with acceptance scenarios
- ‚úÖ Constitutional alignment verified (11 principles + 8 skills)
- ‚úÖ Progressive scaffolding: narrative ‚Üí setup ‚Üí intermediate ‚Üí advanced ‚Üí integration
- ‚úÖ All 5 risks from spec addressed with mitigation strategies

**Key Pedagogical Decisions:**
- Lesson 1 establishes WHY before HOW (narrative foundation)
- Installation before advanced features (early confidence building)
- Subagents before Skills (simpler concept first)
- MCP last with real workflows (highest complexity, practical grounding)
- Optional learning paths (Lessons 3-4 can be skipped if time-constrained)

**Deliverables Created:**
- plan.md (8.9 KB, 198 lines) - Complete lesson architecture
- tasks.md (29 KB, 670 lines) - 100+ specific, testable tasks (~169.5 hours estimated)

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Complete architectural plan for Chapter 5 implementation with 5 lessons, progressive complexity, and full constitutional alignment
- üß™ Tests: All functional requirements, success criteria, and user stories validated against lesson structure
- üìÅ Files: plan.md (lesson architecture), tasks.md (implementation checklist with ~100+ tasks)
- üîÅ Next prompts: /sp.implement to begin Lesson 1 content creation using lesson-writer subagent
- üß† Reflection: Plan successfully balances beginner accessibility with comprehensive coverage of Claude Code's most strategic features (subagents, skills, MCP). Progressive scaffolding ensures no cognitive overload while maintaining technical depth.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - spec was complete and unambiguous, all clarifications resolved
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Constitutional alignment PASS, Functional coverage PASS, Pedagogical structure PASS, Time estimates PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): chapter-planner-v1 (subagent-based planning)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Monitor actual lesson-writing time estimates vs plan; adjust future chapter plans based on actual implementation duration
