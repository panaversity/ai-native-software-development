tests:
  - All tasks follow strict checklist format
  - Each lesson assigned to dedicated lesson-writer subagent
  - content-evaluation-framework skill added to all lessons
  - 13 parallelizable tasks identified
  - 38.5 hour efficiency gain

## Prompt

Review the current tasks and ensure that they are inlined with the plan. Assign each lesson in the tasks to a separate lesson-writer subagent. Also request them to use the evaluation skill as well. Only review the tasks and refine them. Do not implement them yet.

## Response snapshot

Created refined task checklist with 39 tasks across 6 phases. Each of 5 lessons assigned to dedicated lesson-writer subagent with content-evaluation-framework skill. 38.5 hours saved (now 131h vs 169.5h). Parallel execution reduces calendar time from 8-11 weeks to 6-8 weeks.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Refined task structure with subagent specialization and parallel execution opportunities
- 🧪 Tests: All 39 tasks validated against strict format; dependencies mapped
- 📁 Files: tasks-refined.md (complete checklist)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement to begin parallel lesson development
- 🧠 Reflection: Subagent assignment strategy enables true parallel execution and embedded quality gates

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Original tasks too granular; missing parallelization markers
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All requirements met
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard task refinement
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Allow subagents to run prerequisites internally
