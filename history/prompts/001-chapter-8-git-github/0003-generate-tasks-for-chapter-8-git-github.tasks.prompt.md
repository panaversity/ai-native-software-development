## Prompt

User invoked /sp.tasks command with no additional arguments.

Task: Generate an actionable, dependency-ordered tasks.md for Chapter 8 (Git & GitHub for AI-Driven Development) based on available design artifacts (spec.md and plan.md).

## Response snapshot

Generated user story-based tasks.md with 48 tasks organized across 6 phases:

Phase 1: Chapter Foundation (2 tasks)
Phase 2: User Story 1 - Creating Safe Checkpoints (17 tasks) - MVP
Phase 3: User Story 2 - Pull Requests (8 tasks)
Phase 4: User Story 3 - Natural Language Prompts (7 tasks)
Phase 5: User Story 4 - Git History and Blame (3 tasks)
Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting (11 tasks)

Key Features:
- Proper format with task IDs, parallel markers, lesson labels, file paths
- User story organization (P1-P4 priorities)
- Dependencies documented
- MVP strategy: Phase 2 delivers core value

## Outcome

- Impact: Generated actionable tasks.md for Chapter 8 with 48 tasks organized by user story
- Tests: Not applicable - educational content project
- Files: Created tasks.md, backed up original to tasks-old.md
- Next prompts: Begin MVP implementation with Phase 1 and Phase 2
- Reflection: Successfully adapted task generation workflow to educational content context

- Graders run and results: Manual validation - PASS
- Prompt variant: Standard /sp.tasks adapted for educational content
- Next experiment: Proceed with implementation using lesson-writer agent
