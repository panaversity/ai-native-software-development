## Prompt

```
/sp.specify Design chapter 8. Check the part 2 goal provided at book-source\docs\02-AI-Tool-Landscape\README.md
  and the context here context\09_chap8_specs\
```

**Full user request**: Create a comprehensive specification for Chapter 8 "Git & GitHub for AI-Driven Development" as the final chapter of Part 2: AI Tool Landscape. The chapter should teach version control specifically in the context of AI-assisted development workflows.

## Response snapshot

**Created comprehensive specification** for Chapter 8 with the following key components:

### Structure
- **Part I**: Git Commands - Essential Git workflows for AI development
- **Part II**: Natural Language Prompts - How to use AI CLI tools to execute Git operations

### User Stories (Prioritized)
1. **P1**: Creating Safe Checkpoints Before AI Changes (core safety mechanism)
2. **P2**: Collaborating on AI-Generated Code via Pull Requests (team workflows)
3. **P3**: Using Natural Language Prompts for Git Workflows (accessibility layer)
4. **P4**: Understanding Git History and Blame for AI Changes (auditability)

### Requirements Coverage
- **17 Functional Requirements** (FR-001 through FR-017)
  - Part I: 12 requirements for Git command instruction
  - Part II: 5 requirements for natural language prompt alternatives
- **5 Key Entities**: Git Repository, Commit, Branch, Pull Request, Remote Repository
- **8 Success Criteria**: Measurable outcomes including time constraints, completion rates, and capability demonstrations

### Scope Definition
- **In Scope**: Installation, basic workflow, branching, PRs, .gitignore, authentication, natural language prompts
- **Out of Scope**: Advanced Git (rebase, submodules), Git internals, GitHub Actions, GitFlow, Git GUIs
- **Assumptions**: 6 prerequisites including completion of Chapters 5-7
- **Dependencies**: Git CLI, GitHub account, AI CLI tools
- **Constraints**: 3-4 hour completion time, beginner-accessible, cross-platform

### Risk Mitigation
Identified and mitigated 5 key risks:
1. **HIGH**: Accidentally committing secrets (mitigated with early .gitignore teaching)
2. **MEDIUM**: Fear of "breaking everything" (mitigated with rollback emphasis)
3. **MEDIUM**: Platform-specific installation issues (mitigated with detailed guides)
4. **MEDIUM**: GitHub authentication confusion (mitigated with PAT/SSH guidance)
5. **LOW-MEDIUM**: Merge conflict paralysis (mitigated with clear examples and AI assistance)

### Validation Framework
Created comprehensive validation criteria across:
- Content validation (commands tested cross-platform)
- Pedagogical validation (output style compliance, domain skills application)
- Alignment validation (Part 2 goals, AI-first philosophy, modern standards)
- Exercise validation (5+ hands-on exercises, progressive complexity)
- Accessibility validation (platform-specific instructions, jargon definitions)

### Quality Assurance
Created specification quality checklist validating:
- ‚úÖ No implementation details
- ‚úÖ Focus on user value
- ‚úÖ Non-technical stakeholder readability
- ‚úÖ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- ‚úÖ Testable, unambiguous requirements
- ‚úÖ Technology-agnostic success criteria
- ‚úÖ All acceptance scenarios defined
- ‚úÖ Edge cases identified
- ‚úÖ Scope clearly bounded

**Specification status**: READY FOR PLANNING - All quality checks passed, no blocking issues.

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ **Impact**: Comprehensive specification created for Chapter 8 covering both Git commands and natural language AI workflows. Spec aligns with Part 2 goals, constitutional principles, and target audience (beginners with no Git experience). Ready for `/sp.plan` phase.
- üß™ **Tests**: Specification quality checklist created and validated - all items passed. Spec is complete, unambiguous, and ready for planning.
- üìÅ **Files**: Created `specs/001-chapter-8-git-github/spec.md` (325 lines, comprehensive) and `specs/001-chapter-8-git-github/checklists/requirements.md` (quality validation).
- üîÅ **Next prompts**: Run `/sp.plan` to create detailed implementation plan breaking down the chapter into lessons and tasks. Or run `/sp.clarify` if strategic questions arise during planning phase.
- üß† **Reflection**: This specification successfully captures the unique value proposition of Git in AI-driven development: it's the safety net that makes AI collaboration viable. The two-part structure (commands first, then natural language layer) follows the constitutional principle of progressive scaffolding. Prioritization puts safety (P1) before collaboration (P2) before convenience (P3), which is pedagogically sound for beginners working with potentially destructive AI changes.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- **Failure modes observed**: None. Specification process followed standard workflow: analyzed context ‚Üí determined short name ‚Üí checked branches ‚Üí created feature branch ‚Üí wrote spec ‚Üí validated quality ‚Üí created PHR.
- **Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL)**:
  - Quality checklist: PASS (all 13 items)
  - Content quality: PASS (4/4 items)
  - Requirement completeness: PASS (8/8 items)
  - Feature readiness: PASS (4/4 items)
- **Prompt variant (if applicable)**: Standard `/sp.specify` command with context references. User provided Part 2 README and chapter context directory as input.
- **Next experiment (smallest change to try)**: When running `/sp.plan`, validate that the lesson breakdown reflects the two-part structure (Part I: Git Commands, Part II: Natural Language Prompts) and that scaffolding progresses from basic safety (checkpoints, rollback) through collaboration (PRs) to convenience (natural language). Consider whether Part II should be a separate lesson or integrated throughout Part I lessons.
