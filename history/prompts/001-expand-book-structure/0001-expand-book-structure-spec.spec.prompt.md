## Prompt

User invoked `/sp.specify` command with the following feature description:

```
Update Parts and Chapters first before moving to chapter 1. Our update plan:

"Colearning Programming & Agentic AI with Python and TypeScript: The AI-Driven Way" Book.

The book is geared towards teaching beginners how to program Modern Python, TypeScript, and Agentic AI in the new AI Driven Development (AIDD) era.

The book must use Docusaurus 3.9.2 to build the book website. The book will also be publish on our website.

Include:
- Book vision and structure
- Mandatory chapter format
- Code standards (Python 3.13+, type hints, testing)
- Show how AI assistants (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, Zed, Cursor) accelerate development
- Show how Spec-Kit accelerate development
- Docusaurus format requirements
- Writing style guidelines
- Quality assurance checklist
- Non-negotiable rules
- Import all the Claude Code Skills that will used to generate the book

The book structure will be as follows, consisting of 13 parts and 46 chapters:

Part 1: Introducing AI-Driven Development (3 chapters)
Part 2: AI Tool Landscape (4 chapters) ‚Üê Gemini, Claude, Codex overview
Part 3: Prompt & Context Engineering (2 chapters)
Part 4: Python: The Language of AI Agents (12 chapters)
Part 5: Spec-Kit Plus Methodology (3 chapters)
Part 6: Agentic AI Fundamentals with OpenAI Agents SDK in Python (3 chapters)
Part 7: MCP Fundamentals with FastMCP (3 chapters)
Part 8: TypeScript: The Language of Realtime and Interaction (3 Chapters)
Part 9: Building Realtime and Voice Agents (3 Chapters)
Part 10: Containerization & Orchestration using Docker and Kubernetes (3 Chapters)
Part 11: Data, State, and Memory using PostgreSQL, Graph, and Vector Databases (3 Chapters)
Part 12: Event-Driven Architecture using Kafka and Dapr (2 Chapters)
Part 13: Stateful Agents using Dapr Actors and Dapr Workflows (2 Chapters)

Our sequence flows beautifully from "understanding the AI revolution" ‚Üí "meeting the tools" ‚Üí "learning to communicate" ‚Üí "learning to code in Python" ‚Üí "learning Spec Driven Development methodology" ‚Üí "build OpenAI Agents in Python" ‚Üí "build MCP servers" ‚Üí "learn to code in TypeScript" ‚Üí "build realtime and voice agents" ‚Üí "deploy ai agents"

## Response snapshot

**Feature Created**: `001-expand-book-structure`

**Actions Completed**:
1. Generated short name: `expand-book-structure` (3 words, action-noun format)
2. Checked existing branches (remote, local, specs) - none found, assigned number 001
3. Created feature branch: `001-expand-book-structure`
4. Created spec directory: `specs/001-expand-book-structure/`
5. Generated comprehensive specification with:
   - 5 prioritized user stories (P1: Update constitution/docs ‚Üí P2: Restructure existing content + Update Docusaurus ‚Üí P3: Scaffold new parts + Update README/CLAUDE.md)
   - 15 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-015)
   - 7 measurable success criteria (SC-001 through SC-007)
   - 4 edge case scenarios
   - 3 key entities defined (Part, Chapter, Chapter Index)
6. Created specification quality checklist: `specs/001-expand-book-structure/checklists/requirements.md`
7. Validated specification - all checks passed ‚úÖ

**Specification Highlights**:
- Clearly defines transition from 7 parts/32 chapters ‚Üí 13 parts/46 chapters
- Identifies which existing parts expand, contract, or stay the same
- Defines 8 new parts (Parts 6-13) covering advanced topics: Agentic AI, MCP, TypeScript, Realtime Agents, Docker/Kubernetes, Databases, Kafka/Dapr, Stateful Agents
- Technology-agnostic success criteria focused on user outcomes
- No implementation details - focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are unambiguous

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Complete specification created for major book restructuring, ready for planning phase
- üß™ Tests: N/A (specification phase, no code tests)
- üìÅ Files: 2 files created (spec.md, checklists/requirements.md)
- üîÅ Next prompts: `/sp.plan` to break down into concrete tasks
- üß† Reflection: The specification successfully captures a complex restructuring effort with clear priorities. P1 focuses on documentation as the source of truth, P2 on content reorganization, and P3 on new scaffolding. The progressive flow from foundational topics to deployment is well-articulated.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Initial attempt to create PHR used short feature name instead of full directory name (001-expand-book-structure), was corrected
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Specification Quality Checklist - ALL ITEMS PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify command
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider adding a user story for updating cross-references and internal links as a P2 priority (currently only mentioned in edge cases and FR-014)
