PROMPT_TEXT:

Update the constitution to v3.0, clarify the AI development spectrum (Assisted → Driven → Native), and align operational docs (CLAUDE.md, agents, skills) to spec-first and validation-first. Remove or generalize references to skills not present; rename AI teaching skill to ai-collaborate-learning. Add minimal acceptance checks to consistently-used skills.

RESPONSE_TEXT:

- Constitution v3.0: Added “AI Development Spectrum (Assisted → Driven → Native)” under Section I. Clarified emphasis on Driven and Native; preserved planning-first, validation-before-trust, bilingual, deployment principles. Added repo-availability note for skills in II.B.
- CLAUDE.md: Generalized skills references to those present; listed current core skills; ensured subagents/flows enforce spec-first and validation steps.
- Agents: chapter-planner (spec-first, acceptance criteria, tier, closure); lesson-writer (spec→prompt→code→validation, SpecRef, closure); technical-reviewer (spectrum note, sequence check); proof-validator (must-pass gates: acceptance, closure, sources/tests).
- Skills improvements: learning-objectives (Bloom tags, evidence mapping), assessment-builder (objective coverage matrix, validation pack), technical-clarity (gatekeeping auto-fix, spec alignment, audience band), book-scaffolding (tier tags, dependency index), concept-scaffolding (per-step verifiability, load budget), code-example-generator (test snippet, security lint, failure-mode), exercise-designer (difficulty bands, hints, rubric), ai-collaborate-learning (spectrum tag, verification prompts).

OUTCOME:

Constitution and operational artifacts aligned to v3.0 spec-first/validation-first workflow with explicit spectrum framing; repository references constrained to existing skills; agents and skills now include lightweight acceptance checks. Lints clean.
