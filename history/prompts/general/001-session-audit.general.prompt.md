PROMPT_TEXT:

- User: “So we update our constitution and Claude.md ... is it ok?”
- User: “No based on these 2 documents what we updated are @constitution.md and @CLAUDE.md”
- User: “Now review and identify which agent and skills will change ...”
- User: “Sorry before that we need to revise our constitution ... explain difference between AI Assisted / Driven / Native”
- User: “Now we do we need to update/delete/add subagents or skills”
- User: “You are suggesting a lot of skills without any evidence ... strip down to core ideas”
- User: “But we already have spec driven loop ... current things are ...”
- User: “yes it makes sense let's update it carefully”
- User: “Now ensure we are not referring any unpresent skill in constitution or claude.md”
- User: “Now in initial discussion there was a mention to update @ai-augmented-teaching to ai-collaborate-learning ... why not do it.”
- User: “Now let's identify the skills that have no use. Review @prompts library ...”
- User: “Now we can audit the consistently used to see if they can be improved”
- User: “okay do it”
- User: “Now create a single phr that record all prompts and all outputs of this session”

RESPONSE_TEXT:

- Confirmed constitution v3 alignment; added AI Development Spectrum (Assisted → Driven → Native) to `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.
- Scoped subagent updates (chapter-planner, lesson-writer, technical-reviewer, proof-validator) to enforce spec-first, acceptance criteria, closure policy, and spec→prompt→code→validation sequence.
- Constrained `code-example-generator` to require SpecRef, exact prompts, and validation steps; added test snippet, security lint, and failure-mode example.
- Renamed skill label to `ai-collaborate-learning` and updated references.
- Removed references to non-present skills in `CLAUDE.md`; added repository-availability note in constitution.
- Audited prompt history to identify consistently used skills; marked low-usage utilities as optional.
- Enhanced SKILLs with acceptance checks/templates:
  - learning-objectives (Bloom tags, evidence mapping, SpecRef)
  - assessment-builder (objective coverage matrix, validation pack)
  - technical-clarity (gatekeeping auto-fix, spec alignment, audience bands)
  - book-scaffolding (tier tags, dependency index, SpecRef)
  - concept-scaffolding (per-step verifiability, load budget)
  - exercise-designer (difficulty bands, hints, rubric mapping)
  - ai-collaborate-learning (spectrum tag, verification prompts)

OUTCOME:

- Updated files listed in frontmatter; no build/test changes required. All lints clean.
