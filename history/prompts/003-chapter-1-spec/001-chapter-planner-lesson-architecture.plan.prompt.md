## Prompt

Transform Chapter 1 specification into a detailed pedagogical lesson plan with:

1. Lesson-by-lesson breakdown (6 lessons, ~3,500-4,500 words total)
2. Learning objectives per lesson aligned to Bloom's taxonomy
3. Pedagogical structure for each lesson (Show ‚Üí Explain ‚Üí Practice ‚Üí Assess)
4. Content scaffolding strategy (what builds on what, what is foundational)
5. Estimated time per lesson with cumulative budget
6. Integration of all 8 domain skills (learning-objectives, concept-scaffolding, code-example-generator, exercise-designer, assessment-builder, technical-clarity, book-scaffolding, ai-augmented-teaching)
7. README.md with main chapter outcomes, lesson summaries, pedagogical approach, and integration points

**Input Files**:
- `/specs/003-chapter-1-spec/spec.md` - Chapter 1 specification (FR, UC, success criteria, content structure)
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` - Project constitution (principles, domain skills, governance)
- `specs/003-chapter-1-spec/plan.md` - Empty plan template to be filled

**Output Files**:
- `specs/003-chapter-1-spec/plan.md` - Detailed 6-lesson plan with objectives, content, domain skill integration
- `specs/003-chapter-1-spec/README.md` - Chapter overview with learning outcomes, lesson summaries, scaffolding strategy

**Key Requirements**:
- Heavy scaffolding for beginners (define all terms, use analogies, multiple entry points)
- Lesson sequence must respect Lesson 1 as emotional foundation (safety/motivation before technical content)
- Every lesson must have single, measurable learning objective (Bloom's level)
- Show-Then-Explain pedagogy for all lessons (examples before explanations)
- All success criteria from spec must map to lesson assessments
- All 8 domain skills must be visibly integrated and explained

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive, pedagogically sound lesson plan consisting of:

**plan.md** (618 lines):
- 6-lesson architecture with Bloom's objectives, content outlines, pedagogical approaches, and domain skill integration per lesson
- Lesson sequence diagram showing dependencies and rationale
- 5-layer scaffolding strategy (emotional ‚Üí cognitive ‚Üí expectation ‚Üí integration ‚Üí preview)
- Assessment strategy (formative distributed throughout + summative at end)
- Visual resource specifications (5 required diagrams + code examples + solo builder examples + analogies)
- Domain skills integration summary table
- Constitution alignment verification
- Quality gate checklist (16/16 items verified before handoff)

**README.md** (364 lines):
- Chapter overview connecting to Part 1 and Parts 2-7
- 4 chapter-level learning outcomes (Knowledge, Application, Affective domains)
- 6 lesson summaries (Quick reference with focus, key concepts, visuals)
- Table showing how each lesson achieves chapter outcomes
- Pedagogical approach explanation (Show-Then-Explain)
- Integration points (within Part 1, across Parts 2-7)
- 5-layer scaffolding strategy with descriptions
- Domain skills applied (all 8 skills mapped to chapter content)
- Success metrics table with measurement methods and targets
- Constitution alignment with quotes from key principles
- Quality checklist (14/14 items verified before lesson-writer handoff)

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Chapter 1 planning phase complete. Two comprehensive planning documents provide lesson-writer subagent with specific, actionable guidance for implementing 6 lessons. All pedagogical decisions documented with rationale.

- üß™ Tests:
  - Quality gate checklist: 16/16 items verified for plan.md
  - Quality gate checklist: 14/14 items verified for README.md
  - Constitution alignment: Verified Principles 1, 5, 8, 9 explicitly addressed
  - Domain skills: All 8 skills mapped to specific lessons with visible integration
  - Lesson dependencies: Validated sequence from emotional foundation through integration through preview

- üìÅ Files:
  - `specs/003-chapter-1-spec/plan.md` (618 lines, 28kb) - Complete lesson-by-lesson plan
  - `specs/003-chapter-1-spec/README.md` (364 lines, 16kb) - Chapter overview and integration guide

- üîÅ Next prompts:
  1. Lesson-writer subagent invocation with Lesson 1-2 implementation request
  2. Human review checkpoint after Lessons 1-2 complete
  3. Lesson-writer continues with Lessons 3-4
  4. Human review checkpoint after Lessons 3-4 complete
  5. Lesson-writer completes Lessons 5-6
  6. Technical-reviewer subagent validation of complete chapter
  7. Final human editorial review before publication

- üß† Reflection:
  - Successfully applied "chapter-planner" pedagogical architecture to Chapter 1 specification
  - Prioritized emotional/psychological foundation (Lesson 1) before technical content (Lessons 2-3)
  - Scaffolding strategy respects beginner audience and Principle 8 (Inclusivity)
  - All 8 domain skills integrated with specific, visible applications per lesson
  - Lesson dependencies clearly documented to prevent forward references or cognitive overload
  - Assessment strategy distributed (formative) and summative, aligned with spec success criteria
  - Planning ready for lesson-writer implementation with no ambiguity in objectives, content scope, or acceptance criteria

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Planning phase successful with clear, actionable outputs for next phase.

- Graders run and results:
  - ‚úÖ Quality gate checklist (plan.md): 16/16 passed
  - ‚úÖ Quality gate checklist (README.md): 14/14 passed
  - ‚úÖ Lesson dependency validation: All 6 lessons sequenced logically with documented rationale
  - ‚úÖ Domain skill integration: All 8 skills present in lesson architecture
  - ‚úÖ Constitution alignment: Principles 1, 5, 8, 9 explicitly addressed with examples

- Prompt variant: None needed. Initial prompt produced complete, high-quality planning artifacts.

- Next experiment: Lesson-writer subagent will implement Lessons 1-2 following the detailed specifications in plan.md. Human reviewer will validate pedagogical quality, clarity, accessibility, and Constitution alignment. Iterative feedback will refine subsequent lessons.
