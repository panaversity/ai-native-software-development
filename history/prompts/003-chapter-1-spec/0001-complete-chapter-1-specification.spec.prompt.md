## Prompt

```
Complete Chapter 1 @specs/part-1/part-1-spec.md from our part 1. This chapter will set the stage for our vision """To pioneer an **agent-native model of computer science education** where AI is:

* a **co-learner**, participating in exploration and debugging,
* a **collaborator**, shaping ideas and architectures, and
* a **creative partner**, empowering the next generation of AI developers.
""" Also update part as now we think Chapter 1 Content Source is grounded from https://github.com/panaversity/spec-kit-plus/blob/main/docs-plus/ai_coding_revolution_paper.md and chapter 2 will be planned later. We will also update Part 1 intro.md as it's focused on readers not instructors etc.
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive Chapter 1 specification for agent-native education model:

**Core Deliverables**:
1. **Chapter 1 Specification** (specs/003-chapter-1-spec/spec.md)
   - 4 user stories with P1/P2 priorities covering reader journeys
   - 10 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-010)
   - 8 success criteria with specific measurable percentages
   - 6-section content structure (3,500-4,500 words)
   - Detailed pedagogical approach aligned with Constitution

2. **Quality Checklist** (specs/003-chapter-1-spec/checklists/requirements.md)
   - 16-point validation checklist (all items passing)
   - Readiness assessment: ‚úÖ READY FOR PLANNING

3. **Updated Part 1 Specification** (specs/part-1/part-1-spec.md)
   - Revised Chapter 1 section with agent-native education focus
   - Updated with AI Coding Revolution Paper as primary source
   - Clarified learning outcomes and content sources

4. **Updated Part 1 Introduction** (book-source/docs/01-Introducing-AI-Driven-Development/intro.md)
   - Reader-focused (removed instructor guidance)
   - Emphasizes agent-native education model
   - Connects to economic opportunity and vertical markets
   - Updated Chapter 1 & 2 descriptions

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Complete specification for Chapter 1, ready for planning phase. Branch 003-chapter-1-spec created and specifications documented.
- üß™ Tests: Quality checklist created and validated. All requirements testable and unambiguous.
- üìÅ Files: 4 files created/updated with coherent, cross-referenced specifications
- üîÅ Next prompts: Invoke chapter-planner subagent with Chapter 1 spec for detailed lesson planning
- üß† Reflection: Chapter 1 spec successfully grounds agent-native education vision in economic reality (AI Coding Revolution Paper), addresses psychological concerns (AI anxiety), and defines clear pedagogical approach aligned with Constitution principles.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None‚Äîall specifications complete and valid
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Quality checklist 16/16 PASS; Requirements validation PASS; Constitutional alignment PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): None needed‚Äîuser input was clear and specific
- Next experiment: Submit specification to chapter-planner subagent to validate planning feasibility
