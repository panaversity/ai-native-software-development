## Prompt

Now let's plan the full structure and it will previewed for docasorus for all parts and chapters @book-source/docs/ and same in our presetup for ref

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan for book structure (32 chapters across 7 parts) with:

**Constitution Alignment** (GATE: ALL PASS ✅):
- 11/11 principles validated (AI-first, Spec-Kit, Python 3.13+, testing, progressive complexity, consistency, accuracy, accessibility, show-then-explain, real-world, tool diversity)
- 8/8 domain skills aligned (learning-objectives, scaffolding, code-examples, exercises, assessment, clarity, architecture, AI-teaching)
- All ALWAYS/NEVER rules implemented via output styles + review gates

**Technical Context** (Complete):
- Language: Markdown + YAML + Python 3.13+
- Platform: Docusaurus v3.x (static site generation)
- Storage: File-based in `book-source/docs/`
- Performance: Build <60 seconds, instant rendering
- Constraints: Type hints required, filenames match chapter-index.md, consistent structure

**Book Directory Structure** (7 Parts → 32 Chapters):
```
Part 1: 01-Introducing-AI-Driven-Development/ (5 chapters)
Part 2: 02-AI-Tool-Landscape/ (4 chapters)
Part 3: 03-Prompt-and-Context-Engineering/ (4 chapters)
Part 4: 04-Modern-Python-with-Type-Hints/ (8 chapters)
Part 5: 05-Spec-Kit-Methodology/ (5 chapters)
Part 6: 06-Agentic-AI-Fundamentals/ (3 chapters)
Part 7: 07-MCP-Fundamentals/ (3 chapters)
```

**Docusaurus Configuration** (To Create):
- `sidebars.js`: Navigation structure (7 parts → 32 chapters)
- `docusaurus.config.js`: Site metadata and build config
- `package.json`: Dependencies and build scripts

**Phase Breakdown**:
- Phase 0: Research → No NEEDS CLARIFICATION; all decisions locked by Constitution
- Phase 1: Design & Implementation → Data model, Docusaurus config, directory creation, chapter templates
- Phase 2: Quality Validation → Docusaurus build, content validation, navigation validation

**Deliverables**:
1. 7 part folders in `book-source/docs/`
2. 32 chapter placeholder files with YAML frontmatter
3. Docusaurus configuration files
4. Validation report

## Outcome

- ✅ **Impact**: Plan enables immediate directory setup and writer onboarding. Writers know exactly where each chapter goes, what folder structure to use, what frontmatter required. Docusaurus configuration ready for build. Plan is Constitution-compliant and pedagogically sound.

- 🧪 **Tests**:
  - ✅ Constitution Check: All 11 principles pass, 8 skills aligned, ALWAYS/NEVER rules documented
  - ✅ Technical Context: Complete, no unknowns, all decisions documented
  - ✅ Directory Structure: Exact folder names, chapter counts, and filenames provided (matches chapter-index.md)
  - ✅ Configuration Plan: Docusaurus files identified and their purposes clear
  - ✅ Phase Breakdown: Clear phases (no research needed; design → implementation → validation)
  - ✅ Success Criteria: 8 execution-level criteria, all measurable and verifiable

- 📁 **Files**:
  - plan.md: 296 lines, comprehensive, ready for implementation
  - Constitution alignment table: 11 principles + 8 skills + ALWAYS/NEVER rules
  - Directory tree: 7 parts × 32 chapters with exact paths
  - Phase 1 breakdown: Data model, configuration, templates, validation

- 🔁 **Next prompts**:
  1. `/sp.tasks 002-book-structure` → Generate actionable task list for creating directory structure and Docusaurus config
  2. `/sp.implement` → Actually create the 7 part folders, 32 chapter files, and Docusaurus configuration

- 🧠 **Reflection**: Plan successfully translates the beautiful 7-part pedagogical sequence into concrete Docusaurus directory structure. Every part folder maps to a learning phase (foundation → tools → communication → code → methodology → agents → integration). Constitution alignment is 100% (no violations, all principles addressed). The plan is ready for immediate execution by `/sp.tasks` and `/sp.implement`.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- **Failure modes observed**: None. Plan builds on solid specification and constitutional foundation. No conflicts or contradictions.

- **Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL)**:
  - ✅ PASS: Constitution alignment table covers all 11 principles with rationale
  - ✅ PASS: Domain skills alignment documented for all 8 skills
  - ✅ PASS: Non-negotiable rules clearly implemented (ALWAYS/NEVER)
  - ✅ PASS: Technical context complete with no NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers
  - ✅ PASS: Directory structure matches chapter-index.md exactly (32 chapters, 7 parts, correct filenames)
  - ✅ PASS: Docusaurus configuration plan identifies all required files
  - ✅ PASS: Phase breakdown clear and feasible (no research phase needed)
  - ✅ PASS: Success criteria are measurable and verifiable
  - ✅ PASS: Plan is ready for `/sp.tasks` and `/sp.implement` phases

- **Prompt variant (if applicable)**: N/A - User provided clear direction

- **Next experiment (smallest change to try)**: Run `/sp.tasks` to generate detailed task list for creating directories and Docusaurus config files
