## Prompt

Setup Book Structure and Architect overall plan. This will lay the foundation for your peers and writers to start planning and then design the actual content for our book.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive feature specification (002-book-structure) laying the foundation for book development. The specification includes:

**Key Deliverables**:
- **Chapter Index**: All 32 chapters organized into 7 parts with exact titles, filenames, and key topics
- **Constitution**: 11 core principles, 8 domain skills, non-negotiable ALWAYS/NEVER rules
- **Architecture Plan Framework**: Dependency chains, scaffolding strategy, quality gates
- **Output Style Templates**: Reusable formats for chapters, lessons, code examples, exercises

**User Scenarios** (5 total, prioritized):
1. **P1**: Content creators find their assignment and understand scope
2. **P1**: Writers understand quality standards and 11 principles
3. **P1**: Architect plans work systematically with dependency visibility
4. **P2**: Output styles ensure consistency across 32 chapters
5. **P2**: Domain skills are applied consistently

**Success Criteria** (14 total, all measurable):
- Chapter index complete with 32 chapters locatable in <30 seconds
- Constitution documents 11 principles + 8 skills + ALWAYS/NEVER rules
- 7-part structure clear (5+4+4+8+5+3+3 chapters per part)
- Output styles for chapters, lessons, code, exercises defined
- Architect plan identifies 5+ prerequisite chains
- Quality gates specified: spec → outline → draft → review → publication

**Quality Validation**:
- ✅ Specification Quality Checklist created and passed all criteria
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (specification is complete)
- ✅ All requirements testable and unambiguous
- ✅ Success criteria technology-agnostic with specific metrics
- ✅ Edge cases identified and addressed (cross-part dependencies, mid-project changes, skill updates)
- ✅ Scope explicitly bounded (what is/isn't included)

## Outcome

- ✅ **Impact**: Enables structured, parallel chapter development by 26+ writers (AI + human). Prevents scope creep, overlapping content, and quality inconsistencies. Creates single source of truth for chapter assignments, quality standards, and domain skills.

- 🧪 **Tests**: All 14 success criteria are testable. Quality checklist passes all validation items. Specification ready for `/sp.plan` (architect plan creation).

- 📁 **Files**:
  - spec.md: 268 lines, 14 FRs, 14 SCs, 5 user stories
  - requirements.md: Quality checklist (all items pass)

- 🔁 **Next prompts**:
  1. `/sp.plan 002-book-structure` → Create detailed architect plan with dependency chains, scaffolding strategy, timeline
  2. `/sp.tasks 002-book-structure` → Generate actionable task list for finalizing artifacts
  3. `/sp.specify` → Create specs for individual chapter groups (Part 1, Part 2, etc.) as writers come on board

- 🧠 **Reflection**: Specification successfully translates user intent ("setup book structure and architect plan") into comprehensive requirements covering: writer onboarding, quality standards, architectural planning, and output consistency. The 5 user scenarios cover all stakeholder needs (writers, architects, consistency). Constitution v2.0.0 was used as authoritative source, ensuring no invented requirements.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- **Failure modes observed**: None. Specification derived directly from:
  - Existing Constitution v2.0.0 (source of truth)
  - Existing Chapter Index (already complete)
  - Existing output styles framework (referenced, not changed)
  - User intent ("setup book structure and architect overall plan")

- **Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL)**:
  - ✅ PASS: All 14 functional requirements are testable
  - ✅ PASS: All 14 success criteria are measurable and unambiguous
  - ✅ PASS: No implementation details leaked into specification
  - ✅ PASS: Specification is Constitutional-compliant (Principles 1-11, non-negotiable rules)
  - ✅ PASS: Quality checklist passes all 16 validation items

- **Prompt variant (if applicable)**: N/A - User input was clear and complete

- **Next experiment (smallest change to try)**: Move directly to `/sp.plan` to create architect plan with concrete dependency chains and scaffolding levels per part
