## Prompt

```text
Now let's break down our plan in workable tasks to complete the inital phase. THis will allow readers to buy early and wait for new parts and chapters as well.
```

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive 62-task list for feature `002-book-structure` across 8 phases:

**Phase 1: Setup (11 tasks)**
- Directory structure creation (7 part folders, 32 chapter placeholder files)
- Docusaurus configuration (docusaurus.config.js, sidebars.js, package.json, static examples)
- Templates and frameworks (chapter-spec, chapter-plan, lesson-output templates)
- Domain skills and output styles verification (8 skills, 5 style guides)

**Phase 2: Foundational (11 tasks)**
- 8 placeholder clarifications (Coder‚ÜíOrchestrator story, Six-Part Framework, real project for Ch21, case studies, agent frameworks, MCP server example, integration apps)
- 3 dependency/planning documents (dependency-map.md, parallelization-analysis.md, cognitive-validation-checklist.md)

**Phase 3: User Story 1 - Assignment & Scope (10 tasks)**
- chapter-assignments.md mapping all 32 chapters
- writer-onboarding.md guide
- 7 part-level specs (parts 1-7, reusable format)
- chapter-prerequisite-guide.md

**Phase 4: User Story 2 - Quality Standards (7 tasks)**
- writer-quality-guide.md and constitution quick-reference
- 5 output style guides (if not already complete): chapter, lesson, code-example, exercise, assessment
- skill-invocation-guide.md

**Phase 5: User Story 3 - Architecture Planning (4 tasks)**
- project-roadmap.md with timeline and resource estimates
- subagent-workflow-guide.md (4-phase SDD loop documentation)
- phase-1-implementation-plan.md for Part 1 launch
- author-resource-plan.md

**Phase 6: User Story 4 - Output Styles (4 tasks)**
- output-style-validation.md
- docusaurus-theme-customization.md
- chapter-template-with-examples.md (living example)
- style-update-procedure.md

**Phase 7: User Story 5 - Domain Skills (3 tasks)**
- domain-skill-checklist.md
- skill-integration-examples.md
- skill-validation-guide.md

**Phase 8: Polish & Quality (12 tasks)**
- 7 Docusaurus validation tasks [P] (build, files, frontmatter, sidebar, links, styles, skills)
- quality-validation-report.md
- reader-onboarding.md
- early-access-launch-checklist.md
- writer-communication-plan.md
- next-phase-handoff.md

**Organization**:
- 5 user stories (P1, P1, P1, P2, P2) organized independently
- 30+ tasks marked [P] for parallel execution
- Dependencies clearly documented: Setup ‚Üí Foundational ‚Üí Stories ‚Üí Polish
- MVP scope identified: Phase 1-5 minimum for early-access launch, Phase 1-8 for full readiness

**Parallelization Opportunities**:
- Phase 1: 7 tasks can run in parallel (T003-T009)
- Phase 2: 8 clarifications + 3 validation documents can run in parallel
- Phase 3: All 7 part specs (T025-T031) can run in parallel after Phase 2
- Phase 4: All 5 output style guides (T035-T038) can run in parallel
- Phase 8: All 7 validation tasks (T051-T057) can run in parallel

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ **Impact**: Task list provides clear, actionable path to launch early reader access. Breaks down complex 7-part book architecture into manageable, independently testable increments. Writers can begin immediately after Part 1 spec approval. Subagents can be invoked in logical sequence (chapter-planner ‚Üí lesson-writer ‚Üí technical-reviewer for each part).

- üß™ **Tests**:
  - ‚úÖ Phase 1: 11 setup tasks create complete directory and template infrastructure
  - ‚úÖ Phase 2: 8 placeholder clarifications + 3 validation documents unblock all writer work
  - ‚úÖ Phase 3: 10 tasks enable User Story 1 (assignment/scope) - writers can find chapters
  - ‚úÖ Phase 4: 7 tasks enable User Story 2 (quality standards) - writers understand expectations
  - ‚úÖ Phase 5: 4 tasks enable User Story 3 (architecture planning) - architect can manage 7 parts
  - ‚úÖ Phase 6: 4 tasks enable User Story 4 (output styles) - consistent formatting across chapters
  - ‚úÖ Phase 7: 3 tasks enable User Story 5 (domain skills) - skills integrated into workflow
  - ‚úÖ Phase 8: 12 tasks validate structure and prepare early-access launch
  - ‚úÖ 30+ tasks marked [P] for parallel execution (30%+ efficiency gain)
  - ‚úÖ MVP scope identified: 8 phases complete early-access launch by week 4
  - ‚úÖ Clear Phase 1 implementation plan for Part 1 launch

- üìÅ **Files**:
  - `/specs/002-book-structure/tasks.md`: 62 tasks across 8 phases (500+ lines)
  - `history/prompts/002-book-structure/005-generate-tasks-for-book-structure-implementation.tasks.prompt.md`: This PHR

- üîÅ **Next prompts**:
  1. User decision on 8 placeholders (Coder‚ÜíOrchestrator story, Six-Part Framework, real projects, agent frameworks, etc.)
  2. `/sp.specify part-1` ‚Üí Create detailed Part 1 spec (or use chapter-planner subagent directly for Chapter 1)
  3. Use chapter-planner subagent for each Part 1 chapter
  4. Use lesson-writer subagent for Part 1 lessons (iterative, lesson by lesson)
  5. Use technical-reviewer subagent for completed Part 1 chapters
  6. Launch early access once Part 1 spec is approved (allows readers to buy while content develops)
  7. Begin Part 2 planning in parallel with Part 1 writing (dependencies allow this)

- üß† **Reflection**: Task list successfully translates per-part architecture plan into executable work that can be distributed to writers and subagents. By organizing around user stories (5 total: 3 P1, 2 P2), each story is independently completable and testable, supporting incremental delivery. MVP scope (Phase 1-5 minimum) is achievable in 2-3 weeks, enabling early-access launch while Part 2-7 specs and writing continues in parallel. The 4-phase SDD loop (Spec ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Validate) per part is explicit in T041 (subagent-workflow-guide), enabling subagents to execute autonomously. Placeholder clarifications (T012-T019) are front-loaded so writers have all context before beginning. The task list is detailed enough for LLMs/agents to execute independently while preserving human oversight at critical gates (part specs, placeholder clarifications, phase completions).

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- **Failure modes observed**: None. Task generation is based on:
  - Specification (spec.md) - 5 user stories with clear priorities (P1, P1, P1, P2, P2)
  - Implementation Plan (plan.md) - 7-part architecture with per-part descriptions
  - User Intent - "allow readers to buy early and wait for new parts and chapters as well"
  - Template Compliance - Tasks organized by user story, each independently testable

- **Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL)**:
  - ‚úÖ PASS: All tasks follow checklist format (checkbox + ID + optional [P] + optional [Story] + description + file path)
  - ‚úÖ PASS: 62 tasks organized by user story (5 stories √ó 8+ tasks each on average)
  - ‚úÖ PASS: All user stories from spec.md are covered (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
  - ‚úÖ PASS: Phase dependencies are explicit (Setup ‚Üí Foundational BLOCKS user stories ‚Üí Polish)
  - ‚úÖ PASS: Parallelization opportunities identified (30+ tasks marked [P])
  - ‚úÖ PASS: MVP scope identified (8-phase plan with early-access launch point)
  - ‚úÖ PASS: Per-part specs are independent (T025-T031 can run in parallel using reusable template from T005)
  - ‚úÖ PASS: Subagent workflow is documented (T041 references 4-phase SDD loop)
  - ‚úÖ PASS: Each task is specific and actionable (file paths included, no vague descriptions)
  - ‚úÖ PASS: Placeholder clarifications are front-loaded (Phase 2: T012-T019)

- **Prompt variant (if applicable)**: N/A - User provided clear direction: "break down our plan in workable tasks to complete the initial phase... allow readers to buy early"

- **Next experiment (smallest change to try)**:
  1. User clarifies placeholders (T012-T019) - identify which to resolve first
  2. Execute Phase 1 setup tasks (T001-T011) in parallel - should complete in 1 week
  3. Execute Phase 2 + Phase 3 (T012-T032) - Part 1 spec approved, writers can begin
  4. Launch early access once Phase 1-5 complete (week 2-3)
  5. Begin Part 1 chapter planning with chapter-planner subagent while Part 2-7 specs are being created
