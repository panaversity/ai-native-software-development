## Prompt

User invoked `/sp.implement` to execute Phase 1 and Phase 4 of minimal MVP task list for book structure setup.

## Response snapshot

Successfully executed implementation:

**Phase 1: Infrastructure (T001-T003)**
- Created 7 part directories in `book-source/docs/`
- Created 7 part intro files explaining each part
- Created 32 chapter placeholder files with YAML frontmatter

**Phase 4: Validation (T013-T016)**
- Docusaurus build succeeded (zero errors)
- Verified 7 parts + 32 chapters + 40 total files
- Verified sidebar auto-generation with all chapters visible
- Created validation report documenting all checks (all PASS)

**Status**: ✅ Infrastructure complete and ready for early-access launch

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Book structure is physically ready. 7 parts with 32 chapters visible to readers. Infrastructure complete for Phase 2 placeholder clarifications and Phase 3 Part 1 spec creation.

- 🧪 Tests: All 7 tasks PASSED (T001-T003, T013-T016). Total files: 40 markdown. Docusaurus build: SUCCESS. Navigation: 7 parts + 32 chapters visible.

- 📁 Files: 7 part intros + 32 chapter placeholders + validation report created.

- 🔁 Next prompts: Phase 2 (clarify 8 placeholders) → Phase 3 (create Part 1 spec) → Phase beyond (invoke chapter-planner subagent)

- 🧠 Reflection: Minimal MVP approach successful. Focused on essentials only (structure + placeholders + validation). Infrastructure complete in ~1 hour. Ready for user clarifications on 8 placeholder items.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. All tasks succeeded without errors.

- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
  - ✅ PASS: 7/7 part directories created
  - ✅ PASS: 7/7 part intro files created with pedagogical context
  - ✅ PASS: 32/32 chapter files created with proper structure
  - ✅ PASS: Docusaurus build succeeded with zero errors
  - ✅ PASS: All chapters visible in sidebar navigation
  - ✅ PASS: Validation report complete with all checks PASS

- Prompt variant: N/A - standard /sp.implement execution

- Next experiment: Ask user to clarify 8 Phase 2 items, then create Part 1 spec
