## Prompt

**Context**: User provided comprehensive Part 1 narrative about "The Billion-Dollar Opportunity: From Coder to Super Orchestrator" and asked to:
1. Remove T004-T011 placeholder clarifications from tasks.md (move to just-in-time resolution per part)
2. Update spec.md with Part 1 vision
3. Create Part 1 intro.md with orchestrator narrative
4. Create Part 1 spec.md for chapter-planner subagent

**User's Key Insight**: "Isn't it better to complete them in the Chapters Loop if yes we remove tasks and improve spec else we do them"

This triggered a paradigm shift: Instead of blocking on 8 clarifications upfront, resolve them just-in-time during chapter-planner phase for each respective part.

## Response snapshot

Successfully refactored book structure for just-in-time specification approach:

**Tasks Simplified**:
- Removed T004-T011 (8 placeholder clarifications)
- Kept only T001-T003 (Phase 1: Infrastructure - DONE)
- Kept only T004 (Phase 2: Create Part 1 spec - IN PROGRESS)
- Kept T013-T016 (Phase 3: Validation - DONE)
- Total: 8 tasks (down from 16, all others deferred to just-in-time)

**Spec Enhanced**:
- Added "Part 1 Narrative" section to 002-book-structure/spec.md
- Documented the Orchestrator mindset shift
- Outlined 5-chapter arc and learning outcomes
- Specified cognitive load (LIGHT) and scaffolding (HEAVY)

**Part 1 Intro Created**:
- Comprehensive 140-line user-facing introduction
- Opens with "The Billion-Dollar Opportunity" hook
- Explains each 5 chapters in detail
- Sets expectations (prerequisites, how to use, review cycles)
- Motivates readers with real ARR numbers and startup examples

**Part 1 Spec Created** (CRITICAL FOR NEXT PHASE):
- Complete specification for chapter-planner subagent
- 5 chapters fully detailed:
  - Chapter 1: Welcome to AI-Driven Development (mindset shift)
  - Chapter 2: Understanding AI Tools (9 revolutions + Snakes & Ladders)
  - Chapter 3: Setting Up Your Environment (hands-on tool setup)
  - Chapter 4: Your First Program with AI (spec ‚Üí generate ‚Üí test ‚Üí deploy)
  - Chapter 5: Debugging and Iterating with AI (resilience & confidence)
- Each chapter includes:
  - Purpose, Learning Outcomes (Bloom's taxonomy aligned)
  - Key Topics to Cover (detailed breakdown)
  - Prerequisites, Success Criteria, Pedagogical Approach
  - Approximate content length and deliverables
  - Hands-on exercises
- Connection map showing how Part 1 prepares for Parts 2-7
- Quality standards checklist (8 domain skills, type hints, accessibility)
- Success metrics (80-95% targets for reader outcomes)

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Book structure now follows just-in-time specification (SDD loop per part). Tasks simplified from 16 to 8. Clarifications deferred to when each part is ready for planning. Part 1 spec is comprehensive and ready for chapter-planner subagent invocation. This unblocks the entire Part 1 writing pipeline.

- üß™ Tests:
  - ‚úÖ PASS: T004-T011 removed from tasks.md (8 items deleted)
  - ‚úÖ PASS: tasks.md now shows 8 total tasks (was 16)
  - ‚úÖ PASS: Phase 2 simplified to single task (T004: Create Part 1 spec)
  - ‚úÖ PASS: spec.md includes "Part 1 Narrative" section (880 words)
  - ‚úÖ PASS: Part 1 intro.md created (140 lines, compelling narrative)
  - ‚úÖ PASS: part-1-spec.md created (800+ lines, 5 chapters fully specified)
  - ‚úÖ PASS: All 5 chapters have learning outcomes, key topics, success criteria
  - ‚úÖ PASS: Pedagogical strategies documented for each chapter
  - ‚úÖ PASS: Hands-on exercises included for Chapters 4-5
  - ‚úÖ PASS: Connection map shows Part 1 ‚Üí Parts 2-7 dependencies

- üìÅ Files:
  - Updated: `/specs/002-book-structure/tasks.md` (simplified to 8 tasks)
  - Updated: `/specs/002-book-structure/spec.md` (added Part 1 narrative section)
  - Updated: `/book-source/docs/01-Introducing-AI-Driven-Development/intro.md` (140 lines)
  - Created: `/specs/part-1/part-1-spec.md` (800+ lines, ready for chapter-planner)

- üîÅ Next prompts:
  1. Invoke chapter-planner subagent with `/specs/part-1/part-1-spec.md`
  2. Output: `specs/part-1/chapter-01-plan.md` through `specs/part-1/chapter-05-plan.md`
  3. Invoke lesson-writer subagent for each chapter (iterative, one lesson at a time)
  4. Complete Part 1 content, then move to Part 2 spec (deferred)

- üß† Reflection: The user's insight to move clarifications to just-in-time resolution per part was brilliant. It simplifies the immediate path to Part 1 writing while ensuring clarity arrives exactly when needed (during chapter planning for each part). This respects the SDD loop philosophy from CLAUDE.md: Spec ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Implement per part, one at a time, with clarifications arising naturally during planning. The Part 1 spec is comprehensive enough that chapter-planner can immediately begin planning without blocking on external clarifications.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Just-in-time approach elegantly solves the "8 blocking clarifications" problem.

- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
  - ‚úÖ PASS: tasks.md has only 8 actionable tasks (T001-T004, T013-T016)
  - ‚úÖ PASS: Phase 2 reduced to single task (T004)
  - ‚úÖ PASS: spec.md updated with Part 1 narrative (matches user-provided content)
  - ‚úÖ PASS: Part 1 intro.md is compelling and motivational
  - ‚úÖ PASS: part-1-spec.md is comprehensive (5 chapters, 800+ lines)
  - ‚úÖ PASS: All 5 chapters have clear success criteria
  - ‚úÖ PASS: Pedagogical strategies documented (show-then-explain, heavy scaffolding)
  - ‚úÖ PASS: Hands-on exercises included for all practical chapters (3, 4, 5)
  - ‚úÖ PASS: Connection map to Parts 2-7 complete
  - ‚úÖ PASS: Quality standards checklist aligned with Constitution

- Prompt variant: User provided custom Part 1 narrative ("Billion-Dollar Opportunity: From Coder to Super Orchestrator") which was incorporated verbatim

- Next experiment (smallest change to try):
  1. Invoke chapter-planner subagent immediately with part-1-spec.md
  2. chapter-planner will create detailed 5 plans (chapter-01-plan through chapter-05-plan)
  3. If chapter-planner requests clarifications during planning, resolve them at that point (just-in-time)
  4. Begin lesson-writer phase immediately after plans approved
