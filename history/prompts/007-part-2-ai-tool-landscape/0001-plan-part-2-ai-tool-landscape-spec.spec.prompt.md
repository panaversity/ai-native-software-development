## Prompt

Plan part-2 for our book. It will replace book-source\docs\02-AI-Tool-Landscape\README.md . This part will consist of 4 chapters:
1. How It All Started: The Claude Code Phenomenon
2. Google Gemini CLI: Open Source and Everywhere
3. Bash Essentials for AI-Driven Development
4. Git & GitHub for AI-Driven Development

The context shall be grounded with chapters 4-8 here @context/06_chap5_spec/ , @context/07_chap6_spec/ @context/08_chap7_spec/ @context/09_chap8_specs/ . You can follow all the links for each chapter context. You can also use your web search tool to find any ambiguity to avoid hallucination. If you find any link in the readme.md file of the shared context, you must follow those links.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for Part 2 (Chapters 5-8) with:

**User Scenarios (4 P1 Stories)**:
- Claude Code Installation & First Task
- Gemini CLI as Free/Open Alternative
- Bash Essentials for CLI Literacy
- Git & GitHub for AI Safety

**Success Criteria**: 15+ measurable outcomes per chapter plus overall part targets (90% tool adoption, 100% Git literacy, 85% confidence)

**Content Structure**: Clear themes, learning outcomes, and key sections for each chapter

**Design Decisions**: Grounded in existing chapter briefs, Constitution Principle 11 (tool diversity), and pedagogical best practices

**Key Innovation**: Two-part structure for Chapters 7 & 8 (concrete commands + natural language prompts) enables "learning WITH AI" philosophy

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Part 2 specification complete, ready for planning phase with `/sp.plan`. Enables downstream lesson planning and content creation.
- üß™ Tests: Manual validation confirms: spec follows template structure, aligns with constitution principles, includes independent user stories, measurable success criteria
- üìÅ Files: 1 file created (spec.md with 389 lines), committed to feature branch 007-part-2-ai-tool-landscape
- üîÅ Next prompts: `/sp.plan` to create detailed lesson plans and task checklists; then chapter-planner subagent execution
- üß† Reflection: Specification captures learner journey from tool installation through professional workflows. Grounding in existing chapter briefs ensures consistency. Two-part structure (commands + natural language) aligns with "learning WITH AI" not "generating FROM AI".

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None; specification was created holistically from context materials
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All mandatory spec sections completed; requirements are testable; success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A - single comprehensive specification
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): If user provides feedback during spec review, iterate and create v2 before planning phase
