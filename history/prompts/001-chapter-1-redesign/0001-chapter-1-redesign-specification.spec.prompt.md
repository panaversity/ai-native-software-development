## Prompt

Redesign chapter 1. The old chapter was fluffy and without any goal to set stage of this book. Check the part 1 goal provided at book-source\docs\01-Introducing-AI-Driven-Development\README.md and the context here context\02_chap1_spec\readme.md

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for Chapter 1 redesign that transforms the vague request into a focused, evidence-based plan with 28 concrete functional requirements organized into four categories:

1. **Content Structure** (FR-001 to FR-010): Defines the narrative arc from opening hook through $3T economy analysis, software disrupting itself, transformation across dev lifecycle, changing developer roles, autonomous agents evolution, and entrepreneurial opportunities.

2. **Evidence and Sourcing** (FR-011 to FR-014): Mandates specific citations (Stack Overflow, Google DORA, ICPC results) and quantitative evidence (84% developer adoption, Claude Code $500M revenue, 70% more merged PRs).

3. **Pedagogical Elements** (FR-015 to FR-019): Requires "Pause and Reflect" sections, 5-8 concrete examples, strong transitions, and content enrichment patterns (storytelling, historical context, thought experiments).

4. **Style and Tone** (FR-020 to FR-024): Maintains grade 7 reading level, publication quality, active voice, 2,000-2,500 words, avoids "fluffiness".

The spec includes 4 prioritized user stories covering skeptical developers (P1), beginners (P1), educators (P2), and experienced developers (P2). Each user story is independently testable with clear acceptance criteria.

Created quality validation checklist that confirms all requirements are testable, technology-agnostic, and ready for planning phase. No clarifications needed.

## Outcome

- ‚úÖ Impact: Transformed vague "redesign chapter 1" request into 28 testable requirements addressing the "fluffy without goal" problem. Specification provides clear direction for implementation while preserving flexibility in execution.
- üß™ Tests: Quality checklist passed all items. All user stories independently testable. All 10 success criteria measurable.
- üìÅ Files: Created spec.md (244 lines) and requirements.md checklist. Branch 001-chapter-1-redesign created and checked out.
- üîÅ Next prompts: Ready for `/sp.plan` to break down implementation approach and task sequencing.
- üß† Reflection: Successfully balanced multiple audience needs (beginners, developers, educators, skeptics) through prioritized user stories. Addressed "fluffy" concern by requiring evidence-based approach with specific citations and quantitative data. Maintained conceptual focus appropriate for Part 1 while setting up technical content in later parts.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None. Spec creation succeeded on first attempt with no clarifications needed.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All quality checklist items passed. Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All requirements testable and unambiguous.
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): None needed. Proceed to planning phase.
