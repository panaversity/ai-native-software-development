## Key Features

### 1. **Semantic Activation** (Not Keyword-Based)
- Each skill activates based on semantic understanding of context
- Claude understands *when* a skill is needed, not just keyword matching
- Example: "Teach me async/await progressively" → concept-scaffolding activates
- Example: "Review my Python explanation" → technical-clarity activates

### 2. **Progressive Disclosure Architecture**
- **Layer 1**: SKILL.md frontmatter + semantic description
- **Layer 2**: Skill instructions with usage patterns
- **Layer 3**: Reference docs, templates, validation scripts (loaded on demand)

### 3. **Evidence-Based Teaching Strategies**
Each skill integrates established educational research:
- **Bloom's Taxonomy** (learning objectives, assessment)
- **Cognitive Load Theory** (concept scaffolding)
- **Deliberate Practice** (exercise design)
- **Spaced Repetition** (exercise design, assessment)
- **Constructive Alignment** (objectives → exercises → assessment)

### 4. **Validation & Quality Assurance**
- Standalone Python scripts validate outputs
- Scripts run in sandboxed environments (timeout: 5s, temp directory, no network)
- Measurable validation (readability metrics, syntax checking, etc.)

### 5. **Multi-Skill Workflows**
- Skills can be chained together for complex tasks
- Example: learning-objectives → exercise-designer → assessment-builder
- Example: concept-scaffolding → code-example-generator → technical-clarity

## Implementation Highlights

### Core Pedagogical Principles

1. **Measurable Learning Outcomes**
   - All objectives use action verbs from Bloom's taxonomy
   - No vague language ("understand", "know", "learn")
   - Clear success criteria for each objective

2. **Cognitive Load Management**
   - Max 7 steps per scaffold (working memory limit 7±2)
   - Max 3 new concepts per step
   - Progressive fading of guidance

3. **Runnable, Validated Code Examples**
   - All examples execute successfully (>95% success rate)
   - Syntax validated with AST parsing
   - Pedagogically annotated (what/how/why)

4. **Evidence-Based Practice Exercises**
   - Varied exercise types (fill-blank, debug, build, extend)
   - Difficulty progression across exercise sets
   - Spaced repetition patterns for retention

5. **Accessibility & Clarity**
   - Flesch-Kincaid grade level analysis
   - Jargon identification and gatekeeping language detection
   - >80% clarity issue detection rate

6. **Deep Understanding Assessment**
   - 60%+ non-recall questions (higher-order thinking)
   - Meaningful distractors based on common misconceptions
   - Rubrics with clear descriptors

### Testing Infrastructure

- **12 Integration Test Files**: Test semantic activation for all 8 skills

- **Activation Conflict Tests**: Ensure skills don't interfere
- **Semantic Variation Tests**: 40+ varied prompts across 8 skills
- **Unit Tests**: Validate all 10 shared scripts and skill-specific validators

### Documentation

1. **README.md** (.claude/skills/)
   - Explains progressive disclosure architecture
   - Describes all 8 skills with examples
   - Usage principles and best practices

2. **skill-activation-reference.md** (history/)
   - Detailed semantic activation guide
   - 15+ activation examples per skill
   - Troubleshooting and pattern recognition
   - Comparison: semantic vs. keyword-based
